Quite likely their last serious DSLR, the future is mirror-less. That said, this is Nikon's best ever digital camera. Not for beginners, because some very nifty features are hidden deep inside menus. Glow in the dark buttons, fast focus, and yea, great IQ and lots of megapixels if you use FX lenses. I shot a 50mm prime and a few DX lenses, the results are superb. Buy a spare battery and a card, you will need both. Get one if you are serious about Nikon and have old lenses that won't autofocus with lesser DSLRs."

The price is completely justified. Combined with the right glass, this camera is capable of producing some excellent results. I am not a big fan of digital photography; I’m an old fashioned film guy that still shoots with a Hasselblad and 4X5. I somewhat reluctantly bought a Nikon Df as my first “good” digital camera only because of its retro styling. It resembled my F3HP’s.

But having said that, the D850 has won me over. This camera offers the resolution that rivals film and an amazing ISO range. Combine that with high speed operation and the convenience of digital capture and I’ve probably shot my last roll of 35mm film. I’m still going to keep my medium and large format cameras, but holly cow, the images from this camera are simply superb!

I’m a landscape, nature and environmental portrait photographer, so this review should be viewed in that context. I don’t shoot sports, weddings nor do product photography so the specific needs of those photographers are foreign to me. The features that I discuss are important to me, but there may be some missing that are important to you.

Some of my favorite things, in no particular order:

1. The aforementioned resolution is simply fantastic! The capture of details is truly amazing. It’s not 4X5 quality, but it certainly approaches that. And think of all the images one can capture with this camera as opposed to the shots missed with medium and large format gear due to the hassles of lugging it around.

2. The viewfinder is extraordinarily bright. Brilliant!

3. Terrific ability to recover underexposed and shadow areas with very little noise. Far better than I’ve ever seen with other digital capture cameras.

4. Autofocus works extremely well even in low contrast scenes.

5. ISO range is entirely usable. Noise certainly increases at the higher ISO settings, but it is not objectionable.

My only criticism of the camera is that it is big and heavy. It has to be, I suppose, to squeeze in all that technology; nonetheless, it would be nice if it were a bit smaller.

With respect to size, I did get a chance to shoot it side by side with my friends D810. The D850 did sit better in the hand than the D810. The D850 felt a bit heavier, but more comfortable to hold. I believe that was because the D850 is a bit thinner with a deeper hand grip area. At least that’s the way it felt. I won’t do a comparison between the D810 and the D850 because I don’t have any depth of experience with the D810. All I’ll say is that when we compared images side by side in Lightroom, the D850 images were superior in all cases. Not hugely so, mind you, but even my friend agreed the D850 was the undisputed winner.

With only a few days logged with the camera, those are my initial observations. You’ll notice I said nothing about the D850’s video capabilities and that’s because what I don’t know about shooting video would fill an encyclopedia (remember those?). I’ll leave that to those that know what they’re talking about.

But, as a still photographer for some 45+ years now, I couldn’t be happier with the D850. The image quality is stunning. And if that’s all it offered, it would be worth the price of admission. But it also has a host of other features — of which I’m sure you’ve already read — that make this a true standout. I’m so glad I acquired one. I’ll keep my Df because I like the size and the retro styling and I’ll keep my medium and large format cameras just because, but the D850 is going to be my go to camera. And from a film die hard, that’s quite a statement.

My background is about 30 years of professional and semi-professional photography. When I evaluate a camera after a few months of using it, I always ask myself the following question: Would you take this as your only camera on a year-long trip around the world?
With the latest generation Sony RX100V, the answer is: Absolutely, yes! The image quality is excellent and can hold its own even compared to cameras with bigger sensors. The sensor has a remarkable dynamic range and the high ISO noise levels are comparable to full frame cameras a few years back the likes of a Nikon D700. And that's not bad!
Overall I would not be afraid to publish photos out of the RX100V in any high-gloss magazine in any size. The image quality is good enough for any professional work.

The camera has an overwhelming amount of functions for both still and video imagery. Fortunately, the camera can be customized to your taste and skill level. The menu system is cumbersome, but once you set the camera up to your liking, menus hardly have to be accessed. New in this version of the camera - and the main reason I bought it - is the ability to customize your own menu, which allows me to only see the functions I really need.

The pop-up viewfinder is fantastic and unique for a camera is compact. The camera is really hard on the battery, so plan to buy 2-3 extras to get you through a full day of shooting.
The other two items to get for this camera are:
a) the additional hand grip, which Sony should include in the first place.
b) a third party filter adapter which allows you to add filters like a polarizer. The Sony filter adapter does NOT work for this camera (it vignettes). Buy the Lensmate or Magfilter adapters.

Now, before you shell out the cash for this rather expensive camera, you should keep in mind that the camera does not take the photos. You do. If you go to many image forums, you will find many bad and average photos taken with the Sony RX100 series. The reason for that is that people believe the sheer amount of functions in those little cameras can compensate for a lack of talent. They can't. If you are a novice or beginner, you should also set aside some money to take a camera course."

The autofocus system on this camera is excellent and eye tracking is near instantaneous, it takes excellent images and they turn out even better when shooting RAW and post-processing in Adobe Lightroom. I would definitely recommend some form of case and an extra battery if you like to go out and shoot a lot as the camera does feel fragile (though well built) and the battery does leave something to be desired.

My one note to potential buyers is to take note of my experience with Amazon on this purchase, the box arrived and appeared new, but inside was a Sony RX100, the original. Clearly, I was sold an open box item that someone had replaced the RX100VA with an RX100 in hopes it wouldn't be noticed and returned it to Amazon where they promptly listed the item as new, not as a used/open box item with a discount. Amazon accepted my return and provided a full refund, however, I missed out on being able to use the camera for a weekend event I ordered rush shipping to use it for and I now shop elsewhere for all expensive electronic equipment since I cannot trust that was I buy on Amazon is actually a new unopened product."

The card is rated at the same speed as the one I bought from Amazon. Same slow write speed so I know that the camera is defective, not the memory card. This Sony disappointment is being returned to Amazon.

Original Review: I did a lot of research before buying this camera and had high hopes. I am buying a small pocketable camera to replace my big, cumbersome Canon 30D. My main requirement was that it would take better pictures than my iPhone XS Max. If it doesn't, then there would be no point in having the camera since I always have my phone with me.

The Good:

Build quality seems solid.
Form factor is amazing. This thing is tiny and can slip into most pockets.
Great specifications compared to other point and shoot cameras.

The Bad:

The buttons are tiny. I have no problem with it but if you have large fingers, this could be a problem.
No touchscreen so navigating the extensive menu is not that convenient.

The Ugly: I don't know if I have a lemon or what, but this camera is not anything like what's been described in all the reviews. I will be returning it for a refund or a replacement.

Autofocus is slow and not accurate. A bunch of my pics are blurry. My iPhone has better autofocus!

Write speed is the slowest I've ever seen of any digital camera that I've owned dating back over 20 years. It is slow despite that fact that I'm using a SanDisk card that is rated for 170 MB/s. It takes about two or three seconds to write each image. This is simply not acceptable. The slowness made me lose some potentially great shots. will troubleshoot to see if the card is defective but for now, given the other troubles I'm having with the camera, I'm presuming it's the camera.

Auto setting is simply disappointing. I haven't dug into the manual settings yet, but I am judging the camera based on auto function since the camera will be used by multiple members of my family, some of whom wouldn't know how to use manual functions. On auto, the camera is not very smart. I was taking a pic of my daughter with a relative bright background. My iPhone did a wonderful job allowing the pic to display my daughter's face clearly (although a bit dark) and the background clearly. With the Sony, my daughter's face was seen as clearly as with the iPhone but the background was completely white so I could not make out any details in the background.

Hope this review helps. I'm hoping that I just got a lemon and that a replacement would fix all of the above described problems."

I got ride of my Nikon kit for the Olympus EM-d5II because of its size, excellent optics and stabilization. The Sony is for my pocket. I'm very pleased with it with some concerns. You can exhaust a battery just by playing around in its extensive menus. A couple of short videos and some stills and you're changing batteries again. If you don't carry pack at least two spares you'll regret it. The EVF opens in two steps - up and out. I find the pull out section is too easily pushed back into the EVF and has to be pulled out againand again to focus. The positive aspects of this camera are too many to mention. If only Sony could put a slightly longer lens (100mm 35mm equiv) on the 5A it would be the perfect carry around camera for me."

Sony hypes it as ""staggering performance."" The picture quality is great. It can record in 4k. I'm not disappointed with any of the pictures I take with this camera. I'm just not sure what market Sony is trying to target. It's too big slip into your pocket. It's more expensive than an A6000-series camera. It doesn't have interchangeable lenses. When it's on a tripod, you can't swap SD cards or batteries. And you need to swap batteries. (Sony says it can do 220 pictures on one battery. Compare that to 325 for their A6000 or 400 for their HX50, both of which are considerably cheaper than this RX100.) If you don't mind carrying this camera, if you're satisfied with its zoom range and have no desire to swap lenses, and if you don't take that many pictures between charging cycles, this is a fantastic camera."

I wanted something that was quick, easy, light, fun, takes good snaps and was pocketable.
This thing seemed right...fast lens, the 24-70mm equivelent was almost wide enough for my dream camera and for sure long enough. That's where it stopped.
The EVF is...utterly useless. A design perk for photo blogs to vacilate over...that's it. You can't wear glasses and look through it, it's smaller than a damn stamp. The controls are epically too sensitive to operate of you don't have barbie hands....which if you are a small child with a trust fund, this is the camera you'd probably waste your daily $900 stipen on. Trying to run manual mode is a pure excercise in hope and dissapointment. If you spin the dial with no pressure you might...MIGHT be able to change the shutter before knocking it into another mode. This camera would totally benifit from a touch screen or some other control for picking focus points.
The screen flips up in a way that cuts off a portion and also smashes it against the body...likely scratching over time from that.
Honestly....it's too small if you have normal, big hands, it's too hard to use in manual mode to be capturing moments, it's to expensive to be just a ""P"" mode camera compared to others and finally Ef that god damn raw format this camera has. Updating system and applications to open a stupid vacation photo makes me want to flip tables go all angry panda.
I sent it back with a middle finger up. Still don't know what to replace it with. Thinking a fuji or olympus range finder style, but this camera...it blows."

Seidman,"Nice point and shoot for photographers, general consumers will prefer smartphones",2018-12-05,"VIDEO REVIEW TO COME SOON

For photographers this is a feature packed compact camera with an enormous 1"" sensor for super crisp images paired with a decent 1.8 aperture lens for nice bokeh. It has all of the manual control of an SLR for times when a larger camera is not practical to bring along and even has a handy view finder when the sun might be too bright for the rear screen. It can output raw images with Sony's ARW format at about 20 megabytes each at full resolution. I really like its 960 fps shooting mode that can do some awesome slow motion captures.

If this camera was out 10 years ago it would have dominated the marketplace for enthusiasts and consumers alike. But for general consumers a flagship smartphone is better. I just can't recommend this $900 camera to consumers when they may already have a smartphone in their pocket that can deliver a better experience.

1. Image quality: Yes that 1"" sensor makes a huge difference vs. a smartphone. But smartphones are now running powerful image processing in real time to output quality images without the need for much post production editing. The large images from this camera are cold and require editing to achieve the same tones you'll get for little effort out of a smartphone. Photographers will no doubt disagree with this statement but I think for many consumers the output of this camera won't look all that great compared to their smartphones until some tweaking is done.

2. Abysmal battery life: The tiny battery in the camera will visibly drain before your eyes. It's even worse when shooting video. You probably won't get more than 15-20 minutes of life for that.

3. 4k video cuts off after only 5 minutes of shooting: They packed a lot of electronics into this thing and as such it heats up quickly when shooting videos. 4k video looks beautiful especially when the lens is set at a 1.8 aperture but it will overheat and shutdown video recording at the 5 minute mark. And this was indoors at room temperature. Shooting outside on a hot day will no doubt result in an even shorter record time. And then you'll need to wait for it to cool down to do it again.

4. Too many tweaks and settings to get the full feature set: The camera's confusing interface will make sense for photographers but general consumers are going to get lost and likely will change things that will make the experience even worse.

So if you're not looking to make photography a hobby this is not the camera for you. Upgrade to the latest flagship phone to get the pictures you're looking for. If you are looking to get into photography this is also not the camera for you (an entry level SLR is a better buy). But if you are a photographer looking to supplement your larger cameras this is a great camera.

My reason for the low star rating here is that manufacturers need to make these cameras smarter if they want this market segment to survive. When my iPhone can shoot 60fps video at 4k for as long as my battery and storage will allow and deliver better still images without editing it's hard to justify the value proposition here."

These are the best pocket-sized cameras on the market. The one inch sensors and Zeiss lenses give you fantastic image quality, even in low-light situations. The popup viewfinder works reliably and is tremendously useful for outdoor photos in bright sunlight. The newer models support 4K video that looks fantastic. The flip screen and WiFi connectivity to your smartphone give you instant high-quality selfies. Build quality has been great for me. The metal shell is lightweight but very sturdy and the lens motors have lasted for years with no issues. All the RX100 cameras use the same rechargeable batteries and inexpensive 3rd party spare batteries and chargers are available on Amazon and I haven't had any problems with them.

Every year, Sony releases a new model with small but important new features. This year, they released 2 new RX100 cameras, the RX100VA and the RX100VI. These are both great cameras with important differences as well as different prices. The RX100VA is cheaper and has a smaller 3x zoom range, but importantly has a faster lens (bigger maximum aperture so you can use a faster exposure in low light situations). The RX100VI has a bigger 8x zoom range, but a slower lens. How do you choose between a bigger zoom range or a faster lens? That is hard. If you really like low-light photos, you know how important a fast lens is and you will probably go for that. If you like outdoor travel photos or portraits, then you will probably want the bigger zoom range. If you want both a bigger zoom range and faster lens, then you should get something like the Sony RX10 or Sony Alpha, but to get a bigger zoom and faster lens and great image quality, the camera is no longer pocket sized. The trade off is up to you."

Taylor,Stunning Optics and Great Auto Modes Make it Easy to Shoot Like a Pro,2019-10-03,"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this camera. In short.. very nice optics, great flexibility, nice features for novice and advanced photographers alike, great for still picture photographers and for VLOGgers alike, light weight yet sturdy build quality. Great all around advanced point and shooter.

This is a superb alternative to lugging around your DSLR, however people that do most of their photography on a mobile device will not likely carry this camera around instead. I love that it is compact and sports a much larger image sensor than smartphones... which means better picture quality, of course. It has a nice wide aperture Zeiss lens with very speedy autofocus and lightning quick burst mode. It's also quite capable at producing stunning 4K video that rivals much more expensive cameras. Image stabilization is absolutely top notch in both video and still shooting modes. Some folks crab that this isn't a touch screen interface, but I find it easy enough to navigate without putting your finger prints all over your rather gorgeous, bright, articulating screen.

The seller for me apart from the build quality and stunning lens on this camera is frankly the automatic shooting mode. Pictures just look great. You get pro results by just pointing and shooting. It's better than any other point and shoot system I have personally tried. Your results are amazing, taking on an almost filmic quality. Yes, it is a bit on the expensive side, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. One of my favorite point and shoot cams I've ever used, and I otherwise opt for photography using my Canon 80D DSLR. Some of the photos I've taken with the Sony rival those that I've taken with my Canon. the Sony gives the novice an almost unfair advantage.

Overall, I highly recommend this stunning little camera. Sensor, optics, hardware and software all make it easy to shoot pics and video like a pro!"

I bought the Sony A7 II because it shot video, but mostly because it offered a lot of control for manual and auto still photography. I thought it would be an inexpensive backup, but I find myself using it on a daily basis for product photography using wireless electronic studio flash.

Even with the inexpensive 28mm-70mm lens, images are very sharp, color saturation is very good and the optical stabilizing system is very helpful when shooting without flash and at slow shutter speeds.

The control layout is very similar to my Nikon DSLR, so adapting was quick. The menu system is logical and easy to access while shooting. The Sony is light and compact, compared to my other cameras, so it easy to work with throughout the day.

I plan to do a little landscape photography and some night time sky photography now that I've had some time with familiarization. Next lens is a 90mm Macro FE lens. It is good to know that if I purchase a A7 IV that the lenses will carry over with all features. Happy with the purchase."

The body has a rock solid feel and I was pleased with the placement of the dials. I will upgrade lenses down the road as my budget allows. There are two complaints however. The battery charging to the camera is terrible. I recommend buying a secondary charger and battery since the battery life isn't great and the button to release the lens is in an awkward position for my fat little fingers (it is much easier on my Nikon and Olympus to change the lens).

"Sony Alpha a7IIK Mirrorless Digital Camera with 28-70mm Lens, black",4.6,158259.0,195259.0,573,1,86.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"good picture quality,value for money,good for video",,,,,,R.A.O,A Value Deal for Those Interested in Full Frame,2019-11-28,"To preface this review, I think the time for purchasing this particular camera is when it is being sold for under 1000 dollars. This tends to happen frequently throughout the year, especially around the holiday season. In fact, one could also find the body for ~900 new on black friday/cyber monday deals on amazon or other camera stores.

If you already have invested in one system, say Canon or Nikon,or even already own a Sony APS-C camera, I would not recommend the a7II. The a7II is a gateway product that provides the most value to those who have not yet experienced the mirrorless movement of cameras, or even cameras in general.

I will also not recommend this camera to those who are looking into seeking photography as a career. You would probably be better investing in a camera which is 'competitive' to offer top results to clients.

So to begin, who is the Sony a7II perfect for?
This camera is perfect for those who are interested in full frame photography and not so much interested in shooting video. This is the camera for the amateur or the casual shooter who want to reap the rewards that mirrorless designs offer.

While the camera is fairly old, around 4 years as of 2019, do not mistake it as a bad camera. Even in 2019, the image quality and sensor performance is quite impressive. The IBIS, a feature seldom found on cameras of this price range, allows you to take very sharp images in low light situations. Auto focus on this camera is fairly quick and will get you sharp focus in most, if not all, situations. Just know, that high action or high movement subjects will not be easy to focus on using this body. Dynamic range on this camera is also very impressive.

Aside from the built in features, the E-Mount system is the most mature mount system on the market. Since Sony adopted mirrorless designs early, there is a large selection of high quality lenses that can fit almost any budget. The current high value lenses to be looking out for are:

- Tamron 28-75mm F/2.8 which runs for just under 900 dollars MSRP. It is the most bang for you buck zoom lens on the market for the E-Mount system and potentially a lens you will never take off.

- Sigma Art Primes come in various focal lengths and sizes. Again, these lenses are razor sharp and don't break the bank. One could get the a7II kit for 1000 dollars and the Sigma Art 35mm F1.4 and that would still be cheaper than buying an a7III body.

- Samyang/Rokinon lenses. For every Sony lens on the market, there is a Samyang/Rokinon of similar design at a small fraction of the Sony price. This glass is cheap, but quality for what you pay for. Some would even reckon that these lenses surpass some of the available Sony options.

Of course many will be purchasing the a7II Kit which comes with the 28-70mm lens. This kit lens is about the epitome of the 'jack of all trades and master of none' title. It gives access to a pretty standard zoom range, the sharpness is pretty solid even at its wide open aperture of 3.5. It is small and light weight as well, meaning you could easily carry this lens around with you in a bag. But that's about it. You can take very good pictures with this lens, but you'll always be wanting for more in terms of sharpness and aperture options."
"Sony Alpha a7IIK Mirrorless Digital Camera with 28-70mm Lens, black",4.6,158259.0,195259.0,573,1,86.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"good picture quality,value for money,good for video",,,,,,Joe C,"Great camera, wouldn't have spent the extra $100 on kit lens though",2019-05-01,"I was very let down when I first used this camera out of the box but then I popped a prime lens on it and it was AMAZING! Normally I think kit lenses are underrated and take too much abuse but this camera's kit lens is just horrible. Once I put a $198 50mm lens on the camera is was incredible. So this is one of the few times I found recommend you go for the body without the kit lens and buy yourself a good prime instead.

The menu on Sony is terrible and I can't get used to it. It's completely upside down to me coming from Nikon but all that said the camera is just amazing. It's fast and lightweight. It's smaller and lighter than my Nikon DX crop sensor. It's incredible to have what feels like a micro four thirds but is a full frame camera! The 50 and 85mm f1 8 lenses are super affordable and are incredible paired with this camera. I got a 35mm f2 Rokinon pancake lens ($200) to keep on this camera between shoots and with that tiny lens I can carry this camera with me everyday everywhere I go and have a full frame mirrorless on me all the time! Incredible that after all these years as a photographer I finally got a full frame digital camera and it was only $900! You can't beat the price. It's such a great deal.

In body image stabalization is so valuable by itself. I remember when VR lenses were new and that seemed crazy but now any lens I out on this camera gets an extra 2 stops handheld! For video it makes everything looks so smooth.

You can literally shoot at 3200 ISO if you have to and it works. At 1600 ISO it's not even something I have to worry about. I never used to go over 400 ISO on a digital camera, 800 for black and white street stuff but now I will shoot at 800 just to be able to stop down more because it's honestly not an issue.

Oh BATTERY LIFE, not nearly as bad as what I exoected! I think that it's fine. It lasts me all day on one battery without a problem. Also the batteries are super cheap. I got 2 extra batteries and a double charger for them for $35 (in total) with that I have 3 batteries at all times if I need them. If you are really paranoid spent $30 more and get 6 batteries. I'd rather have a small battery and camera and be able to just swap in these cheap tiny batteries as needed. I found that a full day of regular life use can easily last on 1 charge.

Amazing camera!"

1 - Look up some of the prices on the original FX (full frame) DSLRs. As of today, used, they are selling for the same price and feature half the resolution.

2 - It includes amazing features at this price, including image stabilization built into the camera. Yes, many of the lenses have it built in, but now you can adapt your old lenses from other camera models and take advantage of everything the A7II has to offer, including the 5-Axis stabilization and focus magnification.

3 - It is considered a professional mirrorless body. This means it's built in a way and has certain ""high quality"" parts that are often valued because they won't be seen in ""consumer models"" with cost-cutting efforts in mind.

This may not be the camera for you if:

A - You want the latest, greatest and newest model with the most impressive printed specifications. This includes the latest focus and metering technologies.

B - You have specialty needs for your type of photography or preferences. This is something that you have to know ahead of time, and there are plenty of resources online to find out what options you should be looking at instead.

C - You need a more conventional camera and aren't looking to go mirrorless.

Last but not least, I am impressed with this camera. Sony did a great job, no-contest. I still grab a different camera if I need something that powers on instantly so I don't miss a shot, or if I'm shooting a chaotic social event using a speedlight. If not for any other reason, the larger camera lets a group of people know what they should be looking at. (Sony somehow manages to do okay with portraits and direct flash for casual-events, I'm not sure how they managed this...)

Not so long ago it was common to use film, light meters, strobe lights and manually-focused lenses for anything you'd photograph in this image format. Images with superior image quality required professional slide film. Image previews didn't happen until you had film developed, and there was always a cost - which was always a restriction to a hobby.

This is undoubtedly an amazing price for a new full-frame camera and it's image quality exceeds what many could achieve with film in difficult environments and poor technique. Although, to be fair, it's not the only camera on the market and the variety of choices also include cameras that may be better suited for certain people. That aside, I'm obviously impressed."

Sold my a6000 when I got this and it's a massive upgrade. My first full frame digital. The difference is noticeable, but it's not a silver bullet - it doesn't make everything magically better. I am keeping my other crop cameras for both the reach and at least in the case of the a77ii, for its great AF system. The a7ii is primarily for using manual lenses, though the AF works great.

Pros:
* Image quality is great.
* Improved high ISO\low-light performance (over my prior cameras)
* I like the size\weight\handling. Many don't, but I've had 0 issues with it.
* Customizability. Coming from another system it's probably confusing. No problems here, familiar.
* AF system is good. Not the best, but for most it's perfectly fine.
* I'm able to use all my old a-mount FF lenses w\AF on LAEA4 adapter
* Focus peaking, magnification, zebra all very effective and useful for manual focusing
* IBIS for the vintage lenses (as long as you set it properly each time) can be a huge advantage in low-light, especially in conjunction with all the other capabilities.

Cons:
* APSC mode is only 10MP. This is really the only sore point that has me second guessing whether I should have sprung for an a7RII instead. But realistically the price point was beyond my reach atm.
* AF system isn't as good as the newest A7 models or the best DSLR's
* AF on LAEA4 adapter is passable for static subjects, but it's too slow for any sort of action.
* FE lenses can be expensive.

I've had it for about 2 months now, and I really don't have a lot of complaints about this camera at this time. Some of the cons I listed are a bit of a stretch and not specific to the camera. What you get for what you pay is an outstanding value and I don't see that changing. Depending on your needs this may not be the best option for you, the a7 might be sufficient in a more stripped down and compact package, or maybe having the best AF possible is more important than the full frame, etc. There's all sorts of options across many systems. Just think carefully about what you need and avoid an expensive impulse buy."

C.,Switched to Sony from Canon APS-C system,2019-09-27,"The image quality is stunning. The camera produces amazing image quality especially when used in high ISO speed at night. I have also enjoyed shooting with the 28-70mm kit lens. The lens is reasonably sharp. I love the camera and the kit lens from its optical performance. However, I really miss the ease of use of my Canon system. I think most of the reviews here do the justice for the camera's optical performance, so I am going to share a bit about my critiques on the all around usability.

- The viewfinder battery usage is substantial. One battery lasts around 5-6 hours for me. This kind of isn't too big of a deal because I am ok with carrying around 5 extra batteries.
- The settings menu contains nonsense items that god knows what it is controlling. Like what do you expect the phrase ""Audio signal"" to mean? Well, let me tell you. It controls whether the camera beeps when it autofocuses.
- The camera viewfinder is automatically enabled (while turning off the LCD) with the forehead proximity sensor. However, it's extremely annoying when you need to use the LCD but holding the camera close to your body. That distance is obviously not close enough if you want to use the viewfinder.
- The video button is not at a favorable location. It should go to where the manual focus button is.
- All the canon lenses I have have AF/MF physical switches. They are extremely handy. However this doesn't exist for the 2 Sony lenses I have purchased so far (the other is a 28mm f/2)."

I have used it for vacations shots, landscape photos, portraits, astrophotography, sports photos and even low light photos in a cavern. I guess you could think of this camera as a world class decathlete. It is very good at everything but not the very best at anything. I think the three things that makes this camera so good is the image stabilization, the small size and lightness, and the small price for such a high end camera. Even though the high ISO performance isn't the absolute best it is still good and with image stabilization it allows you to shoot at much slower shutter speeds with any lens than nearly any other camera. I took usable photos with the ISO at 6400 and the shutter speed between .5 and one second. These were hand held shots and only one out of four photos were sharp enough but I doubt I could have done that with any other camera. It is not as fast at focusing as my A77m2 nor does it have as many pixels as the A7rII but it takes incredible shots and raw photos have so much depth of information I can pull a lot of detail and contrast and color out of photos that seem too dark and drab at first glance.

So far I am very impressed with this camera. I think it is well worth the price. The only downside is the lack of affordable full frame lenses for the E mount cameras. Sony has decided to market very high end lenses with high end prices. You can either buy expensive Zeiss lenses, expensive Leica lenses or expensive Sony lenses. I think Sony calls them G master or something like that. At least the kit lens seems to be a good lens especially for a kit lens. I have taken some pretty difficult photos with that lens and I have not been disappointed.

It is a good quality product overall. Although, in my case a button stopped working after three weeks. Could be just bad luck.
One should know of the following cons before buying:
1) Battery runs out very quickly. I could hardly complete 200 shots before battery needs replacement
2) Brightness of both the screen and the viewfinder is very dim. It is difficult to see the scene on a sunny day, even on a cloudy day too. I wasn't able to take a macro pic of a bee and a flower because I wasn't able to see the bee in the sun. Very dim.
3) Manual focus is a total disaster. You won't be able to quickly manual focus. It takes significant effort to manual focus as you have to zoom in and focus on a small spot and then scroll the view and check whether the rest of the scene is also in focus. Very hard.
4) The allocation of buttons and functionality is not thoughtful. It is not intuitive at all. You get confused for a couple of weeks before you can remember them."

I have been using a Cannon S90 for the last 4 years honing my skill in composition and exposures before making the investment in the big leagues. My friend who is a professional residential photographer who uses DSLRs recommended me to go with Mirrorless. I mainly wanted a camera for night photography/exploring/traveling. He pointed me to Mirrorless cameras as it is more compact & light weight, yet having specs that rivals DSLRs. For the kit lens I went with online reviews that all said it was a fair lens for the cost.

I fell in love as soon as I shot for the first time & realized what I've been missing out on all these years. This camera has allowed me to explore a different style of photography as I can do things that I previously couldn't. I have taken some amazing shots with this relatively intuitive camera.

You can see some of my Sony A7ii Kit Lens pics on my Instagram account --> @Parker.Chan

Although the kit lens is pretty decent for low light as the INTERNAL STABILIZER in the body helps a lot, if low light photography is what you are into you should invest in a better lens - as I feel like I have already outgrown the lens (though not taking anything away from it. Just look at my low light shots 'Lightroom Edited.')

Overall the A7II is a YES.
- Light weight yet solid feel
- Sleek
- Relatively intuitive to use, yet highly customizable functions
- Pricing: well worth every penny if you enjoy photography

The kit lens is a YES for beginners.
- Good lens to start for beginners who have no idea where to start. Very versatile range for both landscape & portraits.
- Paired with Internal Stablizing function of the A7ii, you can pull of fairly low shutter speed shots by hand @ 1/25 maybe 1/20.
- I really enjoy it and will continue using it for daytime photography."

Not disappointed,2019-12-16,"This camera is rad. My first mirrorless camera-or really my first camera that isn't a smartphone. I'm in love. I've been taking pictures of everything just to get the experience in.

I've been pixel peeping with the kit lens, and the lens is okay, but it's not the greatest thing in the world. The images aren't sharp at long distances, even with manual focus, and it just kind of feels like a junk starter lens. It's okay for close up shots, and capturing what's in front of you, but the aperture is narrow at 3.5/28mm, which gets even more narrow if you utilize the 70mm at 5.6.

Aperture isn't everything and I get that, but compared to a $200 50 mm/f 1.8 that I bought, I feel as if that prime lens can get a wider range of shots than this lens. Moral of the story: if you buy this camera, buy another lens with it.

I also bought a 12mm/ f 2.8 Fisheye lens. It's not particularly my favorite. It's great at capturing a lot of information but feels like TOO much fisheye. With the full-frame sensor on this camera, however, you can't go wrong.

This camera is light, takes fantastic pictures and really has a great value, even though it is a bit of an older camera. I definitely recommend it and am super pleased as this is my first camera."

We have a small (but growing) photography business mainly focused on family photos (newborn, kids, maternity, etc) and we use a Canon 6D with some L and Sigma lenses.

In our personal experience, the Sony A7 II did not meet our expectations as a 6D replacement/upgrade. The image quality is not bad but IQ is only part of what makes a camera great. Below are the pros and cons, when compared to the 6D:

Pros:
-24 MP sensor
-Tilt LCD screen
-Beautiful EVF allows for exposure previewing.
-Focus peaking
-About 2 Stops better dynamic range than my 6D. Excellent to pull details from shadows or fix blown highlights.

Cons:
-Ergonomics. The 6D doesn't fell much heavier than the A7II, all while having a better grip and overall feel in the hands.
-Autofocus is slow in challenging light conditions
-Battery life is pretty bad. I can go trough 3 batteries while the 6D is still on the first one.
-Auto white balance not as precise for rendering skin tones.
-RAW files will fill your buffer quickly, rendering the camera unusable until it finishes writing to memory card. (90 MB/s Sandisk)
-The EVF lags when taking multiple shots. The camera will continue shooting but the EVF is black until it catch up. (not good when photographing kids)
-The process of zooming on a image to review takes 2-3 seconds every time. Unaceptable when working in fast paced environments and need to check for focus accuracy.
-Noisy images beyond ISO 800, even with good light. Based on my tests, ISO 800 on the A7 II is comparable to ISO 2000 on the 6D.
-Good native glass is limited and expensive.
-The menu systems needs to be redesign from scratch .

To summarize, this camera is good if you are a photo enthusiast that focuses on still subjects. For professional work, the 6D is miles ahead. I feel like Sony has all the tech to make a great camera, they just don't know how to put it together yet.

EDIT: I did not purchase this camera from Amazon."

I spent hours on the internet trying to decide which camera to get. I had originally planned to buy a DSLR camera, but my brother in law told me about the ""new"" mirrorless cameras! I decided to go with the Sony, for a couple of reasons: 1. they are the leading company to begin mirrorless cameras, so while Canon and Nikon are also incredible cameras, they are continuing to catch up to Sony and 2. the price is totally worth it. I need the camera for non-professional photography and also for self-tapes (I'm an actress). I didn't need a camera with 4K capability, but the 1080P is incredibly clear. My photos look wonderful and crisp, there are no negatives to this camera! I would say that the lens that comes with it is a decent lens, but I also had a Viltrox 85mm f1.8 and this makes it even more fun to play around! Also, I wouldn't get the Extreme Pro SD card (it's not needed, the Plus is good enough said someone at best buy!!!!)."

I invested in several different lenses for it, comfortable with knowing that if I ever stepped up to a full frame Sony, I could still use them.

Recently the a7ii went on sale and I had to grab it while it was. As great as the a6300 is, I had become kind of obsessed with the sharpness of full frame.

While the a7ii has delivered, I have to say that I still think the a6300 is a more amazing camera for its class. The difference between the a6300 and a7ii shots with a quality prime lens (or even their underrated kit lenses, which I think are great!) is really only noticeable side by side, or by another photographer.

The bigger difference I have seen is the much better quality of shots I get with my long 55-210 E zoom - this lens has gone from usable and flexible to also taking some great shots on the a7ii.

Overall, I have a bit of buyers remorse that I just couldn’t help but upgrade, but so can’t argue that the a7ii takes sharper photos, and Ill definitely be using it a lot in situations where I don’t mind the bulk."

I've always been a fan of mirrorless, and this is one of the best (currently # 23 of all cameras rated by DXO).

Yes, this baby has shortcomings, like dismal battery life, but it matches my FZ1000 (about 360 pictures on a fresh battery)—so not a flaw that is unheard of in top cameras, just far short of the competition. Some of the buttons could be better placed, and the dials (shutter speed/aperture) are too easily nudged and therefore accidentally changed. Built-in image stabilization is a must for me, and one of the main reasons that I bought this camera instead of the A7. However, it is only good for about 3 stops max, by my reckoning—not nearly as good as the stabilization on my FZ1000.

All these could be improved upon, but they're not deal breakers.

The EV plus/minus dial on the top is a big bonus, and many menu items can be accessed instantly by pushing the function (Fn) button, which is conveniently located above the rear dial.

Using vintage lenses, with a Beschoi or Fotodiox adapter, is a snap. Manual focus and settings on this little gem are a dream to use. Focus peaking is easily as accurate as the old split-screen focusing method.

Excellent resolution—plenty of room to crop on this sensor... looks pretty good at higher ISO, too. You can customize this baby until it's all yours.

I bought it with the 28-70 zoom lens, but I mostly use it with my vintage lenses."

Though I've only had the camera for a week I am absolutely impressed with the image quality of the camera so far. I noticed in the reviews there were some gripes about battery life and low light situations but so far I have not experienced anything of that sort. The camera does pack a lot of power in a small body which I understand can drain battery life but that can easily be fixed with extra batteries, the camera grip, or adjusting some of the camera settings. I got about 400 pictures with a single charge with power to spare. Low light photos using my prime came out beautifully, a little noise using the very high ISO settings but nothing that could not be fixed in Lightroom or using better glass. Overall I enjoy the many features the camera comes with such as the 5 axis stabilization & NFC. It is a great buy if you desire a full-frame camera while on a budget. Although you're getting 24MP compared to what the 36 & 42MP the A7r models provide, you still get fantastic image quality. Realistically 24MP is all you need if you're only using your photos for Web content or average print. I hope my review is of help and I will provide a follow up after a month of use"

I was hesitant to purchase because it is a lot of money and I already have a Canon 70d with several lenses, but I really wanted to make the switch to a mirrorless full frame camera. I read a lot of commercial reviews and honestly several of them made me hold off on purchasing it. I ignored them and bought it. I am beyond happy with the results and after using it, I seriously doubt the accuracy of some of the professional reviews I read. Photos are crisp, clear, and sharp. I mostly do night photos, and walking around downtown at night with a longer shutter speed had almost zero effect on the quality of the photos due to the stabilization.

Overall if you are looking for a cheaper full frame camera I would 100% purchase this again"

Yes, Sony makes the A7iii but that's $2K plus camera.
The A7ii though is a very fine 24.3 mp camera with intuitive menu and nice options. Lot's of great videos on Youtube to learn the ins and outs of the a7ii. I shoot in RAW and finishing in Lightroom. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to short battery life and overall picture quality. Solved the battery issue by purchasing a $50 attachable battery grip that holds 2 batteries. The grip also functions as ""Portrait"" shooter with extra shutter button on rotation. Picture quality is quite good but I'm puzzled how in some cases, my 12mp iPhone 8 Plus takes better photos. Not sure what to make of that exactly but that is probably why Sony developed a better sensor for the A7iii. Anyway, if you're getting started into mirrorless digital photography, this is a wonderful starter camera."

Of course it is a $2000.00 camera so I expected better results than my $800 DSLR. The build quality is impressive. It feels as if it is a refined product originally made for military use. It is solid. The size and weight are perfect for my smaller hands so I wonder if it would pose a problem for someone with much larger hands. It has a lot of menus and sub menus. I had to look up where to set the date. I would get use to the downloadable PDF... On your phone. The battery life is not great. I knew this going in so I bought 4 of the RavPower version of this battery with chargers for $50.00 here on Amazon. You could go through 3 full charges in a long day.

I charge them all and don't have to worry about the only thing that I have heard people complain about regarding this camera. I will add more comments after I have used it more.

I bought the original Sony cybershot when it first came out but having been a Canon film user, I stayed with Canon when going digital. It was only after reading the reviews that I bought this my 2nd Sony digital camera and all the reviews on this product is accurate. The controls - once you learn them - are far easier than Canon's. It is light (especially compared to a Canon 7D) and because of its weight, it is now my go-to camera for everything. Because it is full-frame, there is far less noise & captures more light in low-light photos. I took my canon 7D and this camera with me on a trip & except for wide-angle situations where I wanted to use my 10-22 mm lens, I never used my Canon; and the only reason I used my canon was because I didn't have a sony wide-angle and the converter causes vignetting.

Roberts,"Not quite the last camera you'll ever own, but close!",2015-05-10,"I don't think this will be the last camera I will ever own, but I don't expect to buy another one for at least 5 years. The kit zoom is cheap and does not show off the quality of this camera. For that you'll need a better lens. I like the Zeiss 35mm F2.8 as it's small, light and has great color rendition. The image quality is superb with just JPEG. I'm VERY HAPPY with this camera. It's smaller and lighter than a conventional DSLR so you'll take it more places and get great shots. If you're looking at a high-end camera, look no further."

It easily competes with my former Nikons; Canons; Olympus! I bought my refurbished and like new. I would totally do it again. only regret: no flash (this is not as big a deal as I thought it would be!), & I can't yet afford the 24-240, but that is definitely in my future.

However, there are a few issues: 1) Default sound on our camera was silent, so we made an important video with no sound. Not sure why this happened. 2) Focus is slow. Taking picture is slow, if you are used to dSLR. 3) When taking videos, the exposure is not automatically adjusted, which is odd.

""Camera error. Turn power off then on"" is a common error among Sony A7 cameras, at least from what I've seen on online forums. Sony should do a better job in making sure their product is going to work - and last - before they sell them to consumers who are expecting an excellent product.

But while doing street or landscape photography in low light I needed to use my tripod often, which is not possible to use everywhere due to circumstances.

Enter the Z6 ii. This camera performs excellent in terms of handheld low light shooting due to IBIS. Coupled with a fast lens you can shoot hand held at 1/5 th of a sec.

Here are some points which makes this camera shine among its mirroless counterparts from other or same brand.
1. IBIS gives you blurr free photo in most situation where you dont or cant use a tripod. Though for long exposures you will still require one.
2. Excellent low light performance. I was able to get lowlight usable shots upto 12800 ISO.
3. Good color rendition with great dynamic range. In terms of image quality I dont find much marked improvement over d7200. Z6 ii may be a bit more better in recovering shadows and highlights.
4. Focus shift shooting. Now this is very helpful for landscape photos where you need to get the entire scene in focus and sharp.
5. Extended shutter time upto 15 mins which is really helpful for long exposure and astrophotography without using external intervalometer.
6. Crystal clear evf and lcd screen which is very helpful for reviewing photo on screen.
7. About the kit lens 24-70 f4 is very sharp throughout the aperture range.
8. Ability to use ftz adapter for using nikon f mount lenes which can be found in cheaper rates compared to Z mount lens.
9. Ability to use previous old EN EL batteries. I could use my nikon d7200 battery in it.

Some things which I dislike in this camera

1. Unreliable eye detection if subject is bit far though you can still track using lock on tracking.
2. Battery life is very less compared to my nikon d7200. I was able to pull 650 shots with one full battery.
3. Nikon could have slightly increased the megapixel of this camera to atleast 30 mp. As nikon z7 ii was out of my budget and the older z7 having only xqd single slot.
4. 4k 60 fps with 1.5 x crop which is annoying. If thats your requirement then go for panasonic or fuji.

I can recommend anyone to buy this camera if their budget permits. This is an excellent all round camera. If you are a landscape photographer and your budget permits then buy the z7 ii for higher mp as you can get more detail and cropping option."

F. Hindy,Expensive but worth it.,2021-06-20,"I originally bought the GH5 and that camera is a ridiculously good workhorse. However, I shoot predominately consumer electronics, which means I shoot a lot of screens. The GH5, for all its greatness, doesn't have an anti-aliasing filter and that caused all kinds of ridiculous moire. So I sold it, did some research, and landed on the Nikon Z6 II. Super glad I did.

For the record, I upgraded originally from the Nikon D5200, which I used with my trusty Sigma 17-50mm lens for many years. I used the GH5 for a month before I got this camera, which I've now had for about a week.

Pros
1. Good, sharp photos (obviously lens dependent). I did most of my testing with the included Nikon 24-70mm F/4 and my old Sigma 17-50mm F/2.8 with the FTZ adapter. You can find way better photos by much better photographers on pro reviews or other Amazon reviews, but rest assured those reviewers are right. This camera takes excellent photos.
2. The auto-focus features are a bit outside of my wheelhouse (my subjects rarely move while I shoot them), but I did mess around a little bit. I don't know how it compares to its contemporaries, but it beats my old Nikon D5200 by margins I can't possibly overstate.
3. 4k60fps recording works perfectly. Mine came in the box with the software update already installed so I assume yours will too. I didn't have to do anything other than turn it on in the settings. Even with the crop, it's smooth, sharp, and easy to work with.
4. I've always liked Nikon's menu system. It's simple, easy, and effective. Coming from a previous Nikon, the menu is larger, with controls for modern features, but it's more or less the same layout as previous cameras, so it's familiar.
5. The ability to charge the battery in camera via USB-C is awesome. The ability to power the camera with one is even cooler.
6. I also like that I can connect the camera in a bunch of different ways (wifi, bluetooth, usb-c). Compared to old cameras, it's a massive difference.
7. The ability to have a clean HDMI-out and the ability to turn off sleep mode makes this a great webcam for streaming or similar use cases.

Neutral
1. I appreciate that there are two card slots, but I'm not too keen on buying a new card type and a new adapter for my computer.

Cons
1. Nikon is intentionally vague about the USB-C power stuff. They want you to buy a $60 wall charger with a USB-C end. However, you basically just need a 15W power brick with USB Power Delivery (USB PD) and it'll get the job done, and you can find those on Amazon for vastly less money.
2. Having the play and delete buttons on the left side makes the camera difficult to use one-handed. Not the biggest deal, but ergonomics matter.

Finally, a word about OLPF or an ""anti-aliasing filter"". This is an electronic component that, to over-simplify, knocks things ever so slightly out of focus to help avoid moire. It's a technology that does work wonders, especially if you shoot a lot of video or photo of things with screens, like smartphones, computer screens, etc. The Nikon Z6 II has one (the Z7 II does not). If you're here and you're considering a career in tech vlogging/journalism, I would put this toward the top of your ""maybe"" list for that reason alone. Sharp photos and video with the filter is a difficult combo to find.

Overall, this camera is bonkers good. When I asked about it on Reddit, someone there challenged me to find a negative review. Turns out, negative reviews of this camera are exceedingly rare. It does well in low light, regular light, and intense light. The controls are good, the ergonomics are mostly good, the video capture is great, and it's just an all-around powerful workhorse camera.

I also tried the kit lens. It's nice and sharp, and I actually like the part where the barrel compacts and locks for travel. I'll likely use it most of the time since it's a tad sharper than my Sigma, but if the lighting gets difficult, I have no problem switching back to the f/2.8. The kit lens is really good, and getting it at a $400 discount with the bundle is a smart idea unless you already have an outstanding zoom lens, in which case getting a second is redundant.

Finally, a recommendation. If you buy this camera, at MINIMUM, you should consider getting the combo with the FTZ adapter. That gives you access to many older Nikon F-Mount lenses, since the Z-Mount is still kind of new. Buying the adapter separate costs $250, but Nikon reduces the price to $99 if you buy it when you buy a Z-mount camera (Z50, Z5, Z6, Z7, Z6 II, Z7 II, etc). The deal is available straight from Nikon, here on Amazon, or virtually anywhere else you can buy the camera. It functionally triples the number of lenses you can buy (including some really decent cheaper options, like the Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8).

Anyway, this camera is fantastic. Most of the other reviews touch on the kit lens and camera image/video quality, so I wanted to focus mine on some of the technicals and niche stuff. This camera is excellent. I'm happy to have it."

Affordable if you compare it to any full frame sony with the same specifications. I'm using, the original Z mount lenses, a Sigma 150-600mm and Nikon AF-S/AF-P lenses with the FTZ adapter. Everything works perfect. (just remember to calibrate the camera AF for your non Nikon Z mount lenses, to get ultra sharp photos with this camera, the Nikon Z lenses have their own processor so they ""talk"" and sync with the camera every time, they don't need manual calibration) Not thrilled with the object tracking feature YET, it tracks and focus the subject perfectly but it gets ""distracted"" with nearby objects. To be fair, it might very well be that I have not configured the feature properly, the full manual has 800 pages, this machine is a beast, so if you are a pro, please read it, it makes a huge difference.
If you are a wild life photographer like me, get the silicone cover, from ""easycover"" here too, that brand is very rugged and protects the camera from bumps, sand and dust and fits perfectly. See mine attached."

So far, it's taken really great pictures that are on par if not slightly better than the 3300. Added some photos using the Sigma 150-600mm lens.

Pros:
Controls are very easy to use and very intuitive.
real time view finder is great when it works (see cons for more details)
great image quality
Can use all of the older F style lenses with the adapter.
The kit lens is pretty decent overall

Cons:
real time view only works in full manual mode. The perk of mirrorless is instant feedback in the viewfinder, but for some reason it only works in full manual. Using shutter priority mode, the picture looks great and when I go to review it the ISO is clearly too low and it is way under exposed. Because of this, you lose one of the major advantages over DSLR.

The FTZ adapter is expensive if not purchased in a bundle."

A Tate,Glad I Switched to Mirrorless,2021-04-06,"So far, I like this camera. At times, the focus can be a little slow but that could do more with my cheaper lenses. I also have a D850 (which I really like) so there is a small learning curve when it comes to controls location.

The quality is good at higher ISO.

The only thing that I do not like is the when I snap a photo while using the eye viewfinder it will not show up on the LCD screen. It only shows when I do not use the eye viewfinder and snap the shot by viewing on the LCD screen.

When using the eye viewfinder, you can set the camera's settings up so you can see the photo you just snapped through the eye viewfinder but it could cause you to miss the next shot. Which I had the option to view my shot the way I want to, similar to my D850

Other than that, I would recommend this camera"

I found this one and it seemed great. Unfortunately, not so. Starting off on the photo side of things. The autofocus is ok, nothing near Canon or Sony level. Image quality is decent. Image stabilization is pretty good though it can sometimes cause wobbles in the corners of the frame. But the biggest issue of all is that it overheats taking stills. Yes, this camera overheats taking photos outside at any temperature above 70f. If you ignore the overheat, then the camera will shut off completely. For video it's not much better. There is no flip screen, it just tilts up and down which makes filming yourself almost impossible. Again, the autofocus is about middle of the pack. Image stabilization is average. The camera is also missing out on 10-bit video internal. Though it uses CF Express cards. And recording 4k30 you can expect about 20 min of recording before overheating comes up. Even less at 4k60. Overall, a disappointing camera with a high price. I have since gotten the Canon R6 which is better in every way."

The settings and functions go so far beyond an entry-level DSLR – things like taking a still shot during video shooting and adjusting exposure compensation -- that it’s going to take me a long time to learn them all. The included user manual is cursory, not much beyond a point-and-shoot guide; you need to go online to download the full manual to understand what the camera can do. And this camera can do a lot. The only issue I’ve had is with WiFi and Bluetooth connections – more on that near the end.

The high-resolution, full-frame images are amazingly resilient to post-production manipulation. I severely cropped a few of my photos to see how the resolution stood up to extreme enlargement, and I couldn’t believe how far I could take them. While I certainly wouldn’t want to do that in ordinary circumstances, it taught me exactly what the 24.5MP resolution with a quality full-frame sensor could do.

Video is stunning, thanks in large part to its autofocus. The ability to tap the screen to focus on someone or something moving through the frame and staying with that person/object is amazing. You can choose from ten different regular speed frame size/rates and three different slow-motion ones. Even the built-in microphone is impressive, although serious videographers will want to use an external one.

The camera mount takes all Nikkor Z lenses; you’ll have to buy an FTZ adapter separately if you want to use F-mount lenses. The bundled 20-70mm lens yields gorgeous, color-rich, and highly-detailed macro shots, portraits, and landscapes. The optics are first-rate, and it makes a great standard lens for the body. For people like me who like to photograph birds and wildlife, however, this camera has all the tools but not the lens. The high-speed continuous shooting combined with the full-frame sensor, the nimble autofocus, and manual controls can make this a powerful choice for sports and bird photography provided that you have a powerful enough zoom/telephoto lens. In the future, I plan to get both a larger lens and a teleconverter to keep things relatively light.

I love the small details that Nikon has incorporated in the Z 6II. For instance, I like to take stills while looking through a viewfinder but video while looking at a screen. The camera detects when I put the viewfinder to my eye and automatically switches between the two displays in an instant. And I can assign up to three frequently used settings to the dial for quick access. Another nice touch: The dual card slots, while requiring two different kinds (UHS-II SD and XQD), can create a back-up in case one fails or extra onboard storage. The grip is not only perfectly sized for a stable hold, but it also has an indentation on the back that fits my thumb whether I’m shooting horizontally or vertically.

As mentioned in the first paragraph, my biggest headache has been trying to get this camera to connect via WiFi or Bluetooth to either my iPhone or my iMac. No matter how many times I’ve tried, I just cannot do it. Even if I manage to make a connection, as I did once or twice, the settings and connection disappear whenever the camera goes to sleep, which it does every few seconds. Since the app can operate the Z 6II remotely, I’d love to succeed. Plus, I’d love to do wireless transfers to my computer for instant back-ups. It may be a problem with specifically with iOS and Mac OS platforms.

Included in the bundled Z 6II and 20-70mm lens box: the camera body, the lens, a lens shield, a battery, a wall charger, a strap, a USB to USB-C cable, a microfiber wrap for the lens, an HDMI/USB cable clip, and all the necessary caps and protectors.

Although this newest entry into Nikon’s mirrorless Z camera series is designed with serious videographers in mind, still photographers will love it just as much. And if you do both, you will likely be amazed by the power and by how well it does both.

It's the only camera that made me serious to consider switching from my Sony A7iii back to Nikon. I still have many older Nikon lenses in my collection and I was able to use many of them with auto focus using the FTZ mount adapter. It made me fell in love with Nikon camera ergonomics and Nikon colors again.

This camera is a direct competitor with the Sony A7iii. There are many similar features and also different features.

Similar features:
-5 axis BSI sensor
-Human/pet face/eye detection
-PD autofocus points on sensor

Different features:
-3.69 mega pixel electronic view finder!
-4K video at 30fps
-2 card slots but one slot is CFexpress/XQD
-A real functional touchscreen!
-With an adapter, it takes older Nikon lenses with AF
-High resolution rear LCD

The Nikon is very similar to my Sony but yet they both have their strong points. The Sony autofocus is still a tad faster and is about to lock onto a moving subject while taking mostly focused photos. In low-light, the Sony A7iii seemed to perform better but I'm using different lenses on both so it is hard to compare fairly.

The menu system on the Nikon is much more user friendly. Everything seems to be logically grouped together and is easy to find.

I love the color quality of the Z6ii. With skin tones, everything looks more natural and less processed. In the past, Nikon cameras had trouble displaying true red and orange colors. On this camera, they came out accurately. It's truly a beautifully tuned camera.

The included kit lens performed admirably. With a constant F4 and a full range zoom lens, it's easy to use as an everyday lens. It's not perfect for portraits and you don't get creamy bokeh, but it's a tradeoff depending on what you are shooting. It's also always a compromise with otherwise carrying a heavy or focal length limited lens.

If you are a consumer who likes advanced features in a digital camera, this is a reliable camera to pick. It's even better if you already have other compatible gear that you can reuse. You can't go wrong with this Nikon!"

First, note that the ISO was definitely too high in my pictures I attached, I was using manual mode and had it too high, but by time I realized that (sun had come out), the dogs were gone and wouldn't sit still anymore. LOL.
That being said....the ISO...it is amazing. It can go EXTREMELY high making shooting in low lighting possible without a flash.
The main reason I'm obsessed....autotrack focusing!!!!!! This thing tracks eyes super quickly and it actually gets BOTH of my kids' eyes in focus. This was always the most difficult part for me, because with my DSLR I had to manually move the focus point and toddlers move quickly, so it was a struggle to get their eyes in focus most of the time. With this camera, the auto track stays on their eyes no matter where they move, making capturing portraits SO MUCH easier. It also has an animal tracking option if you are shooting animals.

Quiet. When I first started using it, I kept having to check the playback to make sure it was actually taking pictures. The shutter is so quiet!

While I'm not a fan of the lens it came with, it does do a great job.I prefer to use a lower f/stop for portraits, so I'll have to aquire a portrait lens for that, but this took decent enough photos of my kids (and dogs).

The grip is sturdy and comfortable no matter which orientation I'm shooting in.

Dual memory card slots, you can have 2 different types of memory cards so photos can write quickly (depending on the speed card you use) and most importantly, you can write backup to one. This way if your memory card gets corrupted (has happened to me before), you still have everything backed up.

All in all, so far I really love this camera. Will update after I get more acclimated and hopefully get a new lens."

I got this camera because my old DSLR was starting to feel dated both from a picture and video stand point.

After having played around with this for some time now, it is one advanced camera that I honestly feel is too superior for a casual user like me. I love everything about it from the dual card slots to what seems to be a software stability feature. I can single handed shoot pictures and it looks like each shot was done using a tripod. It is unbelievable.

One of the largest upgrades for me is the ability to shoot at night. It is like a night and day difference (no pun intended). I always had a hard time with the lighting at night and ensuring pictures do not come out blurry on my older DSLR. With this, it simply a point and shoot and the picture quality is outstanding. Lastly, one of the bigger selling points for me was the future ability to capture 4k UHD footage at 60p in a February 2021 firmware drop. I can’t wait for that.

As a casual user, I can’t say if the price is worth an upgrade for professional users. My older mid-range DSLR is about 5 years old at this point so this was a large leap forward in technology and quality for me. This is such a great camera; you will not be disappointed."

This camera is my first experience with a mirrorless camera, and although it's certainly heavier than I'd been expecting, the bulk isn't there the way it is with my DSLR. It's a narrower build of outstanding quality. Picture quality is really good, with detailed images, natural colors (especially skin tones,) superior sharpness and dynamic range at high ISOs. The video function and auto focus are fantastic. I have high confidence using this camera, knowing it will stay in focus and be very sharp. The dual card slots are kinda neat since they allow for multiple different types of cards to be used, depending on your preference. This camera also has the ability to charge WHILE being used (using an external battery source) which is great for when you're on the go somewhere, or are out all day and don't have access to an outlet. Overall, this is a fast and accurate camera packed with great features for beginner to advanced users. I'm having fun experimenting and figuring out what it can do, while learning online using the Nikon School website."

Con (only one)
Kit lens compacts down, but has to be opened to shoot, it’s disabled when compact. I love that it gets smaller, dislike it’s not ready to shoot when I pick it up."

Since I shoot a lot of mountain scenery the fact that I can the perfect sunrise shot and sunset shot surpasses any of my other cameras. It creates beautiful images and it's worth every single penny. The 4K video capability is some of the best I've seen is a camera this size and weight it will truly blow you away. Such an amazing value since there are cameras out there that cost way more and produce lower quality images. Highly recommend

Since I am only a hobbyist and not a professional photographer, my review is not a technical comparison of one to the other, although there are features that I will highlight. I realize that the D3500 and the Z6II are in completely different leagues. My review centers around my experience moving from the D3500 to the Z6II. Since I really like the D3500, the anticipated transition to the Z6II was with mixed emotions. On the one hand, I was excited to try the newest technology, and on the other, I was worried that there would be enough change in its operation that there would be a large learning curve. The short version of this long review is that the Z6II is a great replacement for the D3500, and the transition to this model was easy!

I ordered the camera with the 24-70mm lens. Since the lens mount of Nikon’s mirrorless cameras will not directly accept any non-mirrorless lenses, at some point I will acquire the FTZ Mount Adapter, since I have several lenses from the D3500 that I want to use with the Z6II. There is an ordering option where you can order the camera with the FTZ Mount Adapter and no lens. Unless there is a technical reason for this inability for older lenses to fit directly onto the Z6II, then Nikon should not have changed the lens mount. If there is indeed no technical reason for the change, then this is simple money grab.

The kit came with the camera body, a 24-70mm lens and hood, a battery and charger, a neck strap, a USB cord, a hot-shoe cover, a HDMI/USB cable clip, a fabric lens bag, and a manual. The USB cord is used to transfer photos/videos from the camera to a computer. The manual is only a quick start manual that provides basic operating information so that you can start using the camera immediately. The full manual is available online.

The first noticeable difference between the D3500 and the Z6II is the weight. The Z6II body (no lens) is noticeably heavier, which surprised me. I expected that without the mirrored mechanism, the Z6II would be as light, or lighter, than the D3500. As I came to realize though, there are valid reasons for the added weight. The Z6II body is 10oz, or 63%, heavier. I can definitely feel the weight difference when it is in my hands. While I am not a fan of having to wield around additional weight, this ultimately is not an issue. Purely for reference, the total weight, including the standard lenses that are included with each camera, is 23oz for the D3500 and 43.6oz for the Z6II, which is a significant difference. It would not be fair to be critical of this total weight since the included lenses are quite different from each other.

Another noticeable difference is the overall size of the camera body. It is larger in all dimensions. The larger body allows the camera to have a substantially larger rear monitor, which is awesome. This monitor can be swung out in order to adjust the display for easier viewing in cases where you cannot easily see the display directly from behind, such as when taking photos low to the ground, or when using a tripod. There is also room for a digital control panel on top. This control panel displays basic information such as shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and battery level, as well as displaying many mode settings such as flash mode, focus mode, vibration reduction setting, image size, etc.. Much of this information can also be viewed on the rear monitor.

In comparing the layout between the two cameras, most buttons and dials remain positioned in similar locations on the camera. While there are a few exceptions, these different locations were not a transition issue for me. The one big difference in the layout is that the Mode Dial is on the right side of the D3500 but the left side of the Z6II. This was also not an issue. Operating the Mode Dial is also different, as it requires the pressing of a release button in order to move the dial rather than just moving the dial without a release button. I do not like that the Mode Dial does not have the Scene Modes like the D3500. Preprogrammed modes such as portrait, sports, and macro, are no longer on the Mode Dial. Instead, these are replaced with three user programmed modes. Eventually I will figure out the settings for the modes that I like to use and will program them onto the Mode Dial, but it was nice to have the camera already setup for these modes.

There are some operational features of the Z6II that I like. I mentioned earlier about the monitor being hinged so that it can be angled for easier viewing. I always use the monitor when taking photographs or video, so I really like this feature. My husband, on the other hand, always uses the viewfinder for both, except when videoing from a tripod. When we shared the D3500, we needed to manually switch between the monitor and viewfinder when the camera was passed to each other, which sometimes resulted in missed photos. Instead, the Z6II has a feature that automatically switches between the monitor and viewfinder when the eye is placed to the viewfinder, and back to the monitor when the eye is removed. This feature will not work if the monitor is not fully retracted, and it can be overridden with the Monitor Mode button. This is a great feature for us.

One feature that I really like is that when in photo mode, and using the monitor, you can press your finger on the object that you want to focus on, and when you lift your finger the camera will not only focus on that point, but it will also take a picture. Since I use the monitor for all of my photography, this is an awesome shortcut for taking pictures. The other feature that I absolutely love on this model is the eye-detection autofocus and tracking. This is a vast improvement over the D3500!

As I led off saying in this review, I am a hobbyist, not a professional. The more that I learned about the features of the Z6II, the more confident that I became that this is a great choice for an advanced camera that will take me to the next level with my photography. Aside from the vastly improved image quality, there are a significant number of built-in features that I am excited to make use of, once I figure them all out. I am particularly excited about
trying multiple exposure, time lapse, and focus shift photographs.

I loved the D3500. It served me well during years of world travel, and I know that I will love the Z6II even more!"

Update : Don't buy expensive products from amazon. They rejected the replacement blindly. I'm now stuck with the product. Buy from a local store. The delivery boy called and told he can't make the replacement on the day promised and reported on amazon saying the item is broken during their transit. And I'm no longer eligible for replacement. Their fault and they're denying our rights. Woww...what a policy from amazon. When i asked for refund I'm told the return period is over. All because of their fault. The seller was appario. I don't know if it's their fault. Sounds like scam from both Amazon's and seller's end. I'm totally disappointed.

It was a tough decision choosing between this and other full frame options, but in the end I went for the option which will have me take more photos and pursue my interests in photography. I have been a fan of the Fuji designs and find it very easy to control the camera and use all its features to the fullest. Moreover, the full frame camera have lenses which are costlier and bulkier and it take the fun away from mirrorless shooting. Although, the T4 with 16-55mm is also on the heavier side but the lenses are cheaper than their counterparts for full frame.

The best thing I like about this camera is the design and the endless ways in which it can be customised. The AF is amazing with very easy controls through back button, joystick, and the option to use the touch screen to navigate focus points while you use the EVF is simply great. I also feel no other camera produces colors as good as Fuji. Much has been talked about its video capabilities, however, I am not much of a video shooter so won't write about it.

IBIS works great and I have used the camera handheld at 1/2 of a second at 55mm and was pleasantly surprised with the results. Weather proofing helps at extreme conditions. My T20 caught fungus in Mumbai's weather last year while I was away during the lockdown so the feature is certainly helpful. The battery backup is really good, although I hated when Fuji didn't include a charger with the body. I purchases the Fuji dual battery charger as I don't want to risk frying the camera in adverse scenarios by directly charging through it. I am not saying it will happen, but I am not willing to take the risk. The choice of quality crop lenses available is another great reason to go for the camera.

Overall it's a great camera with some really phenomenal capabilities. You get the IBIS which T3 lacked and weather sealing which the XH1 lacked. AF is great and the camera is fun to use. So buy it if you feel the camera will make you use it and become a better photographer."

Il cambiamento è stato notevole. In un primo momento sono rimasto perplesso da alcuni aspetti (ad esempio la resa del colore o il modo in cui l’autofocus è gestito) ma in breve tempo questi sono divenuti punti di forza della X-T4 ai quali non rinucerei.
Se prima (sia con la a7R-II citata, sia con la a6100, con la RX-100 VI, con la RX-0 II, sia anche con i vari modelli Pentax o Olympus), mi trovano ogni volta ad editare e rifare tutte le foto da file RAW tramite Capture One Pro, ora con la X-T4 in tanti casi ottengo già JPG di ottima qualità, che una post produzione fatica molto a migliorare.
Le immagini delle persone e soprattutto i ritratti sono inarrivabili, ma anche le immagini di paesaggio, una volta trovate le giuste impostazioni, sono eccellenti, con una resa generale spesso sorprendente.
Di seguito, dopo alcuni mesi di utilizzo piuttosto intenso, le mie impressioni sulla fotocamera, divise per argomenti.

CORPO MACCHINA
La qualità costruttiva della X-T4 è altissima e fa sembrare di fattura economica l’ottimo corpo della a7R-II. Il corpo è costruito con larghissimo uso della lega di alluminio e magnesio e la sensazione è quella di un prodotto professionale, realizzato senza compromessi. Il peso è relativamente elevato, non dissimile da quello di molte mirrorless full frame, ma la qualità costruttiva si sente.
Le ghiere fisiche, realizzare magnificamente, danno una piacevolezza nell’uso che dopo breve tempo diviene irrinunciabile.
L’unico appunto che mi sento di muovere sta nell’ergonomia dell’impugnatura, che è discreta ma non è migliore di quella (non eccellente) della Sony già citata: nulla a che fare con la perfetta sagomatura dei corpi Pentax, ad esempio.

COMANDI
Come detto sopra, le ghiere fisiche sono eccellenti e dopo breve tempo non si riesce più a farne a meno.
Trovo irrinunciabile anche la netta divisione tra i controlli fotografici e quelli video, che può essere selezionata nel menù.
I pulsanti sono tutti posizionati bene e dopo breve tempo ci si abitua.

MENU
Il migliore che abbia provato sinora. Sony è nota per l’astrusa distribuzione dei menù delle sue fotocamere, ma devo dire che l’organizzazione adottata da Fujifilm mi ha soddisfatto anche più di quella di Olympus o Pentax.

SENSORE
E’ un punto di assoluta forza del prodotto e va oltre le aspettative.
Pur se di superficie dimezzata, riesce persino a rivaleggiare con quello della a7R-II, che come noto resta ancora oggi un riferimento per profondità cromatica e gamma dinamica.
La Sony full frame mantiene un ovvio vantaggio sia in tali due aspetti, sia per quanto riguarda il rumore ad alti ISO. Nello specifico, comunque, la differenza di resa ad ISO elevati è quantificabile in 1 stop, mentre la gamma dinamica mostra uno scarto ancora più contenuto. La profondità cromatica può essere valutata solo in laboratorio, ma personalmente, con le stesse immagini, non riesco a riscontrare differenze significative (salva l’ovvia differente resa dei colori).
Rispetto alla Sony a6100 (che ho anch’essa) la X-T4 mostra un certo vantaggio in tutti gli aspetti sopra citati.
Riguardo alla risoluzione, invece, la X-T4 si attesta sullo stesso livello dei sensori APS-C da 24 Mpixel, dato che i soli 2 Mpixel in più non sono apprezzabili in concreto. I 42 Mpixel della a7R-II restano su un altro livello.

X-TRANS
In più occasioni mi è capitato di riscontrare direttamente l’assenza o la bassa presenza dell’effetto moiré. Si tratta, naturalmente, di immagini in cui il soggetto ripreso presenta pattern regolari particolarmente fitti, come la trama di un tessuto.
Ad ogni modo, la distribuzione su matrice più ampia costituisce un pregio rilevante in certi contesti.

RESA AD ISO ELEVATI
Eccellente. Come detto, risulta migliore di quella dei sensori APS-C retroilluminati da 24 Mpixel di Sony, che già sono ad altri livelli del settore.
Non sfigura neppure a confronto con l’ancora ottimo full frame della Sonu a7R-II, rispetto al quale cede circa uno stop in termini di disturbo, soprattutto di luminanza.

RESA CROMATICA
E’ un punto di forza di grande valore.
Quando ho acquistato la macchina credevo che non avrei mai utilizzato le simulazioni di pellicola, ritenendole una caratteristica inutile.
Per di più, nei primi giorni di utilizzo sono rimasto perplesso dalla resa cromatica delle foto di paesaggio, che mi parevano strane nelle tinte, soprattutto per quanto concerne il cielo.
In breve tempo, però, mi sono reso conto che i colori Fujifilm sono migliori e più fedeli rispetto a quelli reali. Scattando le stesse immagini con le altre fotocamere che ho, ho constatato che solo i colori di Olympus riescono ad avvicinarsi all’eccellente resa della X-T4. Pentax, Sony e Panasonic hanno ciascuno i propri aspetti di irrealtà.
Per le foto di paesaggio preferisco la resa della simulazione Astia Soft, che satura leggermente le tinte più importanti per questo genere di immagini (verdi, gialli, rossi) e che rende gli azzurri con una tonalità leggermente più spostata verso il magenta, dando una maggiore profondità al cielo ed al mare.
Egualmente, utilizzo la Astia Soft anche per le fotografie di persone, in cui la X-T4 eccelle sotto tutti i punti di vista. Se ci si abitua a fotografare i volti con le tinte Fujifilm, non si può più farne a meno.

GAMMA DINAMICA
Come accennato, è veramente di grande livello, ponendosi appena sotto a quella di un ottimo sensore full frame quale quello della Sony a7R-II.
Grazie anche al ridotto rumore, il recupero nelle ombre è formidabile. Eccellente anche quello nelle alte luci.
In più, la tendenza della macchina a sottoesporre leggermente in tante situazione permette di incrementare ulteriormente il recupero delle aree più chiare.

ESPOSIZIONE AUTOMATICA
Abbastanza buona, ma migliorabile. In molte situazioni la X-T4 tende a sottoesporre di 1/3 EV o talvolta anche di 2/3 EV. Io scatto costantemente con la compensazione dell’esposizione su +1/3 EV e di solito ottengo ottimi risultati.
Tale tendenza alla sottoesposizione, tuttavia, ha il vantaggio di conservare molto bene le alte luci.

OTTURATORE
Ha un suono contenuto, ma molto piacevole. Ricorda quello delle fotocamere a pellicola di fascia alta. Davvero soddisfacente.
E’ possibile anche attivare la modalità totalmente silenziosa.

AUTOFOCUS
E’ valido, ma con alcuni distinguo.
In modalità AF-S è eccellente, almeno per il mio modo di usarlo: lo preferisco a quello dei copri Sony che ho, perché lo lascio sempre in modalità a singola zona e la sposto in pochi istanti grazie all’ottimo joistick, che purtroppo manca in tutti i corpy Sony che ho (ma che è presente in altri più recenti). In tal modo, la messa a fuoco avviene sempre dove voglio e l’aggancio del soggetto è rapidissima anche in condizioni critiche.
Discreto il riconoscimento dei volti ed tracking sull’occhio: funziona bene, ma non è preciso e tenace quanto quelli Sony, che rimangono un punto di riferimento assoluto.
In modalità AF-C la resa del sistema è variabile in base al contesto. In generale è buona, senza eccellere, con soddisfacente affidabilità che però è inferiore rispetto a quella dei sistemi Sony.
In modalità tracciamento, invece, siamo ben lontani, con una percentuale di scatti a fuoco decisamente inferiore rispetto, ancora una volta, a quella dei sistemi di tracciamento Sony.
Per il mio tipo di fotografia e videografia, che è prevalentemente paesaggistica e di taglio documentaristico, la X-T4 va benissimo e l’autofocus è perfetto. Ma per chi si occupi di soggetti in rapido movimento una recente Sony potrebbe essere una scelta migliore.

STABILIZZAZIONE
Altro punto di forza della macchina.
Non eguaglia quella dei modelli Olympus e Panasonic micro quattro-terzi, vero punto di riferimento in questo campo, ma risulta comunque di buon livello.
Anche con ottiche non stabilizzate (ho il Tokina 23 f/1.4 ed il TT-Artisan 17 f/1.4) si riesce a scattare ad 1/30 sec. con immagini tutte perfettamente nitide; ad 1/15 la percentuale di successo, a mano libera, è molto elevata, dell’ordine del 90%, quantomeno facendo attenzione a stare ben fermi. Si può arrivare anche a tempi sorprendentemente bassi, come ½ di secondo, ma ovviamente con plurimi tentativi.
In abbinamento ad un’ottica stabilizzata come il 16-80 f/4, invece, le prestazioni sono formidabili con immagini tutte buone anche ad 1/6 sec a 16 mm e ad 1/20 a 80 mm.
In campo video, invece, la fotocamera risulta ben al di sopra di tanti altri modelli, fermo restando che Olympus e Panasonic fanno meglio. Attivando anche la modalità boost, si riesce a riprendere bene a mano libera, purché si stia fermi. Basta solo appoggiare i gomiti ad un muretto, ad esempio, per avere immagini paragonabili a quella a cavalletto.
Naturalmente, per sequenze in cui la fotocamera deve muoversi è opportuno ricorrere ad un gimball.

EVF
Ha caratteristiche tecniche di tutto rispetto, ma ha un difetto per me importante.
E’ un’ottima unità OLED, con risoluzione non da primato ma pur sempre parecchio elevata e molto soddisfacente. Ha un contrasto formidabile con una notevole percezione di profondità.
Ottima anche la temperatura di colore, che riproduce quella effettivamente registrata dalla macchina.
Quello che non mi soddisfa del tutto è la saturazione eccessiva: l’immagine inquadrata è rappresentata con tinte sopra-sature, che sono meravigliose da vedere, ma che non corrispondono a quelle poi realmente registrate dalla macchina. Questo vale in particolar modo per i cieli blu, ma anche per i colori della vegetazione autunnale.
Basterebbe introdurre una regolazione della saturazione per limitare il problema.
Ad ogni modo, quando mi serve avere una riproduzione fedele della scena ripresa mi affido al display esterno. In tutti gli altri casi, ossia quasi sempre, utilizzo la straordinaria visione che offre il mirino OLED.

DISPLAY
Ottimo. Nitido, con alta risoluzione e fedeltà cromatica perfetta.
La funzione tattile è ineccepibile, precisa ed affidabilissima.
Il sistema incernieratura su tre assi non è gradito a tutti ed in effetti ha i suoi limiti, così come i sui pregi. Personalmente preferisco la praticità di quelli solamente inclinabili, rapidi da aprire e richiudere.
Tuttavia di questo apprezzo sia la possibilità di utilizzarlo ruotato in avanti anche con flash o faretto LED montato sulla fotocamera, sia la possibilità di richiuderlo verso l’interno della macchina, con totale protezione dello schermo.
Il suo retro, peraltro, presenta una bella finitura che ricorda quella delle fotocamere a pellicola degli anni ‘70 e ‘80.

CONNESSIONE BLUETOOTH E WIFI
Davvero ottimo il sistema di connessione all’applicazione (ho provato quella per Android) che si avvale di un trasmettitore Bluetooth a bassa energia per un collegamento costante ed automatico con lo smartphone (che ovviamente deve avere il BT attivo).
Vengono così inviati costantemente i dati di posizionamento (coordinate GPS) e viene anche avviata automaticamente la connessione WIFI non appena l’utente avvia un’operazione che la richiede, come il trasferimento di immagini, oppure il controllo remoto della fotocamera da applicazione.
Ne sono molto soddisfatto e lo considero il migliore tra i sistemi che ho provato.

OTTICHE
Qui non posso che scrivere brevi cenni.
Ho acquistato la macchina in kit con il Fujionon 16-80 f/4, che ha il pregio di essere tropicalizzato, stabilizzato e pure adatto alle riprese video.
E’ un’ottica veramente notevole, con ottima risolvenza praticamente a tutte le focali.
L’autofocus è rapidissimo in quasi ogni contesto, incluse le basse luci.
L’escursione, equivalente a quella di un 24-120 mm (approssimativamente, rispetto a ottiche full-frame) ed è, quindi, estremamente versatile.
Rispetto al Sony 18-135, che uso spesso con la a6100, questo è molto più pesante ed ingombrante, ma la qualità costruttiva non è minimamente paragonabile, essendo l’ottica Sony un pezzo di plastica (che però sforna ottime immagini in tantissimi casi).
Ho anche acquistato il Tokina 23 f/1.4, che ho già recensito a parte su Amazon, del quale sono soddisfatto e che in abbinamento alla X-T4 lavora molto bene.

Allego qualche immagine di esempio."

Über die XT-4 ist hier ja schon vieles (sehr positives) geschrieben worden - ich konzentriere mich daher auf die aus meiner Sicht wesentlichsten Punkte.
1. Klar hat mich als älteres Semester das Retro-Design der Kamera sofort angesprochen. Und in silber sieht die Kamera einfach nur klasse aus!
Aber man merkt relativ schnell, daß die Drehräder auch Nachteile haben: Wer setzt gerne die Kamera ab, um beispielsweise an den Knöpfen beispielsweise die Belichtungszeit oder die Belichtungskorrektur einzustellen? Also habe ich relativ schnell wesentliche Funktionen auf die Drehräder ausgelagert. Das ist schlichtweg einfacher und praktischer zu handeln!
2. Klasse finde ich auch, daß es völlig getrennte Menue-Einstellungen für den Photo- und Videomodus gibt.
3. Aber warum muß ich oben an der Kamera mühselig zwischen Photo- und Videomodus umschalten? Ich mache Bilder UND Videos und wieso gibt es keinen Rec-Knopf auf der Kamera, mit dem ich ohne Umschalterei direkt ein Video aufnehmen kann? Und wieso muß ich bei Wechsel von Photo- zu Videoaufnahmen immer mühselig den Focuswahlhebel umschalten von Einzel- auf kontinuierlichen Autofocus? Kann man das nicht automatisieren?
4. Das Menü selbst ist (wie bei vielen Kameras) sehr unlogisch aufgebaut und dann noch mit teilweise völlig unverständlichen Übersetzungen in die deutsche Sprache. Und wieso bleibt die Kamera nicht auf dem letzten aufgerufenen Menüpunkt, wenn ich die Einstellungen wieder aufrufe? Jedes Mal wieder durch die Menüs durchzuhangeln, wenn ich z.B. die Filmsimulation ändern will ist doch unnötig, oder?
5. Was man alles über die Menüs einstellen kann ist echt unglaublich! Man hat das Gefühl, man könnte mit dem Teil auch ne Rakete starten! Ja, die Einstell- / Konfigurationsmöglichkeiten sind super, aber auch ziemlich kompliziert und man braucht ne ganze Zeit, um da halbwegs durchzublicken!
6. Hat man die Einstellungen hingefummelt wird man durch eine hervorragende Bildqualität bei Photos und Videos belohnt. Allerdings scheint mir der Vorverstärker für das Mikrofon (ich verwende das sehr gut getestete externe Mikro Sennheise MK-400) nicht von allzu guter Qualität zu sein, denn man hat insbesonders bei leisen Passagen doch ein ziemliches Störgeräusch.
7. Hinweis: Das 16-80mm Kit-Objektiv ist wegen der unterdurchschnittlichen Bildstabilisierung gerade für Videoaufnahmen nicht gut geeignet. Besser das 18-55mm nehmen.
8. Die Low Light - Fähigkeiten der Fuji sind der helle Wahnsinn! Was da bei hohen ISO-Zahlen noch an guten Bildern raus kommt ist echt irre!
9. Mit den neu konzipierten Batterien hat man endlich eine gute Laufzeit.
10. Der Autofocus und die Gesichtserkennung wurde im Vergleich zur X-T3 deutlich verbessert. Aber es ist gerade im Vergleich zu den Sony-Kameras noch deutlich Luft nach oben!
11. Mit den Filmsimulationen kann man sich auch durch die individuelle Konfigurierbarkeit richtig austoben und individuelle Looks erstellen

Trotz der beschriebenen Nachteile: Die Fuji X-T4 ist eine klasse und sehr gut verarbeitete Kamera mit vielen Konfigurationsmöglichkeiten (wenn man da mal durchgeblickt hat). Ich würde sie wieder kaufen."

Mon XT-3 était la solution au dos et aux épaules flingués après une longue journée, mais il m'énervait quand il insistait sur une valeur ISO stratosphérique pour une prise facilement gérée à 800 en plein format. Le boîtier souffrait également d'un peu de jeu sur la bague avec certains objectifs.
La stabilisation du capteur sur le XT-4 compense partiellement le problème de l'ISO. La qualité de construction est encore meilleure que le XT-3 (aussi bonne que sur le Canon 5D IV). La nouvelle batterie rattrape l'autonomie minable du XT-3, mais il faut en acheter au moins une de rechange quel que soit son appareil. Même les inconditionnels du RAW apprécient la qualité des jpg et les simulations Fuji. Par contre, optez pour Capture One si vous préférez photographier en RAW avec votre Fuji. Lightroom et Photoshop gèrent fort mal la démosaïcisation des capteurs X-trans, d'autant plus qu'on se trouve régulièrement dans des valeurs ISO élevées.
L’érgonomie du XT-4 est encore meilleure que sur le XT-3, et la personnalisation est facile et claire. Après une courte session de familiarisation on sait comment ajuster ses réglages tout en gardant le regard sur le sujet. Fini le temps perdu à fouiller dans les menus compliqués pour un réglage de base. Ça, c’est un appareil bien pensé, certainement par rapport aux horreurs des menus Sony et Olympus. Le côte ‘rétro’ des molettes de réglages (qui sont fermes, mais pas trop) amusera les photographes expérimentés et facilitera l’apprentissage des débutants. Je recommande cet appareil aux voyageurs, aux débutants qui veulent progresser et aux photographes amateurs exigeants. Oui, il s’adresse à un public aussi large…
L’autofocus Fuji n’est pas le meilleur de sa catégorie, mais il est tout à fait performant. N’étant pas vidéographe, je me contenterai de signaler les problèmes de réchauffement (partagés par tous les appareils) et de faire l’écho des commentaires comme quoi le XT-4 serait le meilleur APS-C à faire très bien ET photo ET vidéo.
Là où Fuji peine, c’est dans l’absence de bons flashes. La marque vient d’annoncer un nouveau (un réalité un flash tiers rebadgé en Fuji) à un prix trop élevé. Heureusement, Godox comble bien le déficit avec un excellent rapport prix-qualité. Dans le kit XT-3 il y avait un petit flash plutôt inutile ; dans l’offre boîtier nu XT-4 rien.
Un dernier mot sur les objectifs Fujifilm dont le kit 18-55 mm f2.8-f4 OIS est étonnamment performant. Si vos exigences dépassent les performances des premiers objectifs, vous allez vous retrouver acheter des produits certes moins chers que les cailloux pro de chez Sony, Canon ou Nikon, mais pas beaucoup plus petits ni plus légers."

Ottima durata della batteria, così come la fattura del corpo macchina stesso, la strap per portarla in giro e le ghiere fisiche presenti per la regolazione di ISO, tempi (Shutter) e per compensare l'esposizione.

Acquistata dopo aver venduto una Canon C100 MkII: no regrets! Super consigliata!"

Irgendwann bin auf Youtube auf die Fuji XT4 gestoßen durch Reviews und Sample Videos und war schlichtweg überrascht von den Specs der Kamera. Mein Fokus liegt eigentlich auf Cinematography/Videgrafie und ich habe auch eine BMPCC4K, mit welcher ich sehr zufrieden bin, aber die Fuji XT4 hat sehr gute Specs hinsichtlich ihrer Video Funktion:
- 4K DCI mit bis zu 400Mbit in 10Bit All Intra in 4:2:0 (über HDMI sind auch 4:2:2) möglich
- so eine hohe Bitrate hat man bei der Sony A7III oder Lumix S5 nicht (die Sony hat nicht mal 10Bit...)
- das hauseigene Flog ermöglicht intensives Color Grading und bietet maximale Dynamic Range
- man kann auch mit den Fujifilm Film Simulationen filmen (Classic Chrome, Eterna), was out of the box zu ziemlich schönen Looks führt (siehe Youtube für Beispiele)
- der Autofokus ist ziemlich gut, gibt auch Gesichtserkennung, was für Youtuber/Vlogger gut geeignet ist
- schwenkbares, gut aufgelöstes Display mit Touch
- Zebrafunktion
- bis zu DCI 4K@60 FPS
- IBIS (ist ganz in Ordnung, aber ersetzt keinen Gimbal für Videos)
- übersichtliches und einfach zu bedienendes Menü

Diese kann Kamera kann locker mit der Sony A7SIII mithalten, klar die Fuji hat keine 4K@120 FPS und eine krassen Low Light Modus wie A7SIII, aber dafür kostet sie nicht doppelt so viel die Sony. Fuji bietet viele gute Objektive an, die auch nicht übertrieben teuer sind wie beispielsweise die Lumix L Mount Objektive, jedoch hat Sony wesentlich mehr Auswahl. 2021 soll es aber erstmalig Sigma Art Objektive geben für den Fuji X Mount, was erfreulicherweise zu mehr Optionen führt.
Ich benutze diese Kamera auch für die Fotografie, hauptsächlich Urban / Street Photography und zusammen mit den zuvor genannten Film Simulationen insbesondere Classic Chrome kann man perfekte Bilder rausholen (JPEG) ohne dass irgendwelche Fotobearbeitungen von Nöten wären. Diese Kamera kann man schlussendlich als perfekte Hybrid Kamera bezeichnen und sie muss sich definitiv nicht vor Sony etc. verstecken. Die Kamera an sich ist sehr hochwertig verarbeitet und der allgemeine Look (habe die silberne Variante) sieht sehr schön aus, sieht wie eine Vintage Kamera aus. Mit dem Kit Objektiv 16-55 F2.8-4 ist sie aber auch kein Leichtgewicht. Was auch positiv anzumerken ist, dass die Kamera einen Dual SD Card Slot hat, sodass man immer genug Speicher hat und nicht nur auf eine Karte angewiesen ist. Der wirklich einzige Kritikpunkt an der XT4 ist, dass kein Ladegerät für den Akku mitgeliefert wird. Man hat lediglich ein USB C Netzteil, worüber man die Kamera laden kann, für den Preis ist das nicht akzeptabel.

Fazit: Diese Kamera ist für alle geeignet, die eine gute Foto UND Video Kamera haben wollen, es ist also die perfekte Hybrid Kamera, für Hobby Filmmaker Cinematographen und Youtuber/Content Creator. Das ist meine erste Fuji Kamera und definitiv nicht die letzte."

Kiphard,Die mit Abstand beste Foto- und Videokamera in diesem Preissegment - Videomonster!,2020-09-09,"Eine kleine Vorgeschichte zu der Kamera. Ich habe seit 4 Jahren die Sony RX 10 M3, eine sehr gute Bridgekamera mit einem tollen Objektiv. Aber ich bin zu 90 % Videofilmer und mit 4k 30p kann man nur mit Stativ filmen. Dann vor 2 Monaten gedacht, dann kaufe ich mir einen Camcorder, es war der Panasonic HC-X 1500. Ich war maßlos enttäuscht von der Bildqualität und Fotos kann man halt auch nicht damit machen. Tests gelesen und natürlich auch in der Bestenliste von Videoaktiv nachgesehen, da steht diese Kamera auf Rang 3, die davor und die danach kosten ein Vielfaches mehr. Naja, und wenn ich dann hier in Rezensionen einen Sterneabzug lese, weil nicht genügend Zubehör dabei ist, dann finde ich das schon merkwürdig. Was Fuji hier vom Preis-Leistungsverhältnis auf die Beine gebracht hat, das ist einfach sensationell.
Kommen wir zu den Details.

Bildqualität
- Diese ist einfach herausragend. Ein gestochen scharfes Bild, sehr gute und natürliche Farben, hier muss man natürlich die entsprechende Einstellung wählen.
- Komme aber gleich auf die Videoeinstellungen zu sprechen, im Zusammenhang mit dem Bildstabilisator

Bildstabilisator
- Hier hat Fuji große und gute Arbeit geleistet. Das OIS, besonders im Boost-Modus, dann noch die Objektive mit OIS ermöglichen es, auch bei freihändigen Videoaufnahmen bei UHD oder 4k 60p sehr gute Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Immer darauf achten, wenn Cam auf Stativ, OIS ausschalten.

Gehäuse
- Habe es in Silber gewählt, sieht wirklich retromäßig und unglaublich chic aus. Qualität empfinde ich auch als sehr gut.
- Funktionen am Gehäuse sind einfach großartig, alle wichtige Einstellungen direkt verfügbar, das ist das Beste, was ich bislang hatte.

Objektive
- Ich habe neben dem Standardkit das 55-200 gekauft. Hatte zunächst überlegt das teure 50-140 zu kaufen, das ist aber zu schwer und von der Bildqualität nicht direkt sichtbar besser. Das günstige 55-200 macht phantastische Aufnahmen und gefällt mir noch besser als das 18-55, aber etwas Weitwinkel muss halt auch sein.
- Wichtig! Sowohl für das Gehäuse als auch die Objektive die Firmware updaten, dadurch hat man noch weit bessere Ergebnisse

Autofokus
- Da bin ich in meiner Beurteilung noch etwas zurückhaltend, beim Filmen hatte ich da einige Probleme, aber man muss sich auch erst einmal mit den Einstellungen vertraut machen.
Lowlight-Iso-Verhalten
- Dafür ist diese Kamera bekannt, sie ist relativ rauscharm, aber das geht auch nicht alles von alleine. Man muss dafür schon die richtigen Einstellungen wählen und üben.

SD-Kartentipp
- Man braucht nicht unbedingt eine Karte mit 300er Geschwindigkeit. Ich habe die Sandisk mit 170, die hat bei allen Aufnahmen gut funktioniert.

Fazit
Eine von der Leistung her eher günstige Kamera mit herausragenden Eigenschaften, für den Profi genauso geeignet wie für den ambitionierten Hobbyfotografen und vor allem auch Videofilmer. Ich bin sehr begeistert von dieser Kamera. Natürlich muss man erst einmal einiges investieren, aber man hat mit dieser tollen Kamera wirklich jederzeit Spaß."

X-T1, X-T2, X-H1, X-T3... et naturellement, j'ai voulu passé au X-T4.

Et pour la première fois, je n'ai pas vu l'upgrade.

3 raisons principales :

-> L'AF moins rapide que le X-T3 en AF-S (single).
En AF-C (continue), la différence est minime, mais en AF-S, c'est le jour et la nuit. Le X-T3 dans le domaine est une tuerie. Il fait la mise au point instantanément. Comme le font les OMD... Mais concernant le X-T4, il y a un léger temps de réaction (que je mets sur le dos du capteur à stabiliser) et surtout si on appuie d'un coup sec sur le déclencheur la photo sera le plus souvent prise sans que la mise au point soit terminée. Donc une photo légèrement floue à la clé. On observe le même type de mise au point molle sur les Sony A7III (appareil que j'ai revendu pour cette raison) ou la série des X100 (appareil que j'utilise abondamment ).

-> L'écran tactile sur rotule qui est moins pratique en photo que l'écran sur bascule.
Autant pour de la vidéo, c'est assez pratique dans certaines situations, autant en photo, le fait de basculer accélère significativement la réactivité en situations réelle...

-> L'autonomie devient excellente, uniquement quand on désactive le stabilisateur. Avec le stabilisateur, l'autonomie n'est pas significativement meilleure qu'avec un X-T3.
X-T4 (IBIS on) : 1400 photos avec une batterie
X-T3 : 1200 photos avec une batterie
X-T4 (IBIS off) : 2500 photos...

Bref, c'est un chouette appareil. Mais pas aussi réactif que son grand frère le X-T3, qui reste pour moi une référence."

Ich war erstmal sehr irritiert. So was kannte ich noch nicht. Der Bote war auch irritiert, wahrscheinlich weil irritiert war. Dann kam mit die Idee doch nochmal schnell in die Mails zu sehen, und siehe da Amazon hat mir eine Zahl mitgeteilt die man angeben soll. Eine gute Idee, so werden teurere Bestellungen nicht einfach vor die Tür gelegt, geklingelt und weg.
So, jetzt zur Kamera. die XT4 ist anders als meine Nikon DSLR (810, 500), gut das das Internet erfunden wurde und es Youtube gibt.
Gekauft habe ich die XT4 zum filmen, da sie auch Fotos kann, habe ich vollem Mutes auf Still umgeschaltet.
Mein übliches Setup ist, mit Zeitautomatik zu fotografieren.
Das bei der Fuji anders, mein 16-80mm hat ein Blendenring und der ist nicht nur zur Zierde da, der will benutzt werden, da soll man erstmal drauf kommen:-)
Also, nach Einarbeitung ist mir gelungen auch sehr schöne Bilder zu produzieren.
Auch das Auslösegeräusch ist eine Traum und der IBIS funktioniert sehr gut, sie wird einen festen Platz im Fotorucksack bekommen."

Le ghiere analogiche sono insostituibili per quanto mi riguarda, la camera è robusta, tropicalizzata e stupenda da vedere. Lo sportello snodabile è un plus estremamente comodo per fare video, ma lo trovo utile pure per le foto, che sono eccezionali. Qualcuno lamenta un'impugnatura troppo piccola e altre inezie per me inesistenti. Personalmente la trovo comoda (e ho pure le mani piuttosto grandi) e piacevole da maneggiare, con tutto a portata di mano, proprio come nelle vecchie analogiche. Ditemi ciò che vi pare, ma non sopporto di dover smanettare tra i menu per associare pulsanti e diavolerie varie; ci stanno le ghiere di una volta, e sta tutto lì sopra, con tanto di regolazione di diaframma sull'obiettivo e non su un'asettica ghiera in mezzo alle dita.

Ich habe mich von all meinem Equipment getrennt und mir die X-T4 gekauft. Ich habe es zu keinem Zeitpunkt bereut!

Da ich mich neben der Fotografie auch für Filmografie interessiere, habe ich nach einer Allround-Kamera gesucht. Zur Auswahl standen Sony Alpha A6600. Panasonic GH5. Letztendlich haben mich die Features der X-T4 überzeugt und ich habe den höheren Preis auch in Kauf genommen.

Die X-T4 finde ich optisch und haptisch sehr ansprechend. Das Retro-Design gefällt mir sehr. Für mich, als Nikon-Nutzer war der Umstieg schon etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber ich habe mich schnell an die neue Kamera gewöhnt und habe mich in sie verliebt.

Die Kamera incl. meinem Kit-Objektiv liegt gut in der Hand und ist vom Gewicht her auch angenehm.

Den Flipscreen nutze ich sehr gerne, nur hier habe ich irgendwie Angst, dass das Scharnier abbricht. Es wirkt für mich nicht extrem stabil. Mal sehen, wie gut das geht. Vielleicht täusche ich mich aber auch. Des Weiteren finde ich es nicht besonders gut, dass all Kabel (USB-C, Mic...) an der gleichen Seite sind, wie das Scharnier des Bildschirms. Wenn ein Kabel eingesteckt ist, lässt sich das Display nicht mehr nach Belieben drehen. Das waren aus meiner Sicht die einzigen Nachteile dieser Kamera.

Von den Video-Features bin ich begeistert: 4k mit 60 FPS, FHD in 240 FPS, Filmsimulationen, Bildstabilisator…

Der Fokus ist schnell und funktioniert auch bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen einwandfrei.

Es macht ja wenig Sinn, die ganzen Features aufzuzählen. Davon gibt es unzählige Videos. Ich kann nur sagen, ich bin begeistert. Die Kamera hat so viel zu bieten, dass man täglich was Neues entdeckt. Es macht einfach Spaß damit herauszugehen und zu fotografieren oder zu filmen."

Linke,Beste APSC Kamera!,2020-12-18,"Eine absolut geniale Kamera! Optisch im Retro Style gehalten, aber vollgepackt mit high end Technik.

Die Bedienung ist bei Fuji generell sehr eigen, aber wer sich damit etwas auseinandersetzt findet sich schnell zurecht. Man hat für sehr viele Funktionen Einstellräder. Das mag man oder eben nicht. Das Menü ist ebenfalls sehr übersichtlich und intuitiv gestaltet.

Umgestiegen auf die X-T4 bin ich vor ca. 3 Monaten. Vorher hatte ich eine Sony A6600, welche natürlich auch eine sehr gute Kamera ist. Jedoch bietet die Fuji eine Menge Vorteile. Zum Beispiel der geniale Sucher oder das 1a Display! welches nicht nur dreh- und schwenkbar ist, sondern auch sehr hell werden kann und eine sehr gute Auflösung besitzt.

Lediglich in Sachen Autofokus und Ergonomie hatte meine Sony noch ein bisschen die Nase vorn. Letzteres lässt sich allerdings mit einem Zusatzgriff von zB SmallRig schnell beheben.

Auch das Übertragen von Bildern auf das Smartphone funktioniert mit dieser Kamera problemlos.

Was ich nicht so sehr beurteilen kann, sind die Video Features, da ich die Kamera überwiegend zum Fotografieren benutze. Jedoch widme ich mich diesem Gebiet später noch intensiver, weshalb ich darauf auch etwas beim Kauf geachtet habe. Ob man zB nun 4K 60fps braucht oder nicht, muss man am Ende des Tages selber wissen. Doch haben ist immer besser als brauchen. Auch das Thema Akku ist als Hobby-Fotograf nicht zwingend Kaufkriterium Nummer 1. Ich komme bequem über mehrere Tage Nutzung. Wie gesagt ich fotografiere überwiegend damit. Im Videobereich sieht es da schon wieder anders aus.

Was jedoch auch beachtet werden sollte ist, dass es momentan noch(!) wenig Drittanbieter für Objektive gibt. Fujifilm hat zwar einen eigenen gut ausgestatteten Objektiv-Fuhrpark, jedoch sind die Objektive recht teuer wenn man sie neu kauft. Meine Erfahrungen mit den Fuji-Objektiven sind allerdings durchaus positive. Man bekommt auch eine entsprechende Qualität für sein Geld.

Ich wurde bis jetzt nicht enttäuscht und kann das Fuji-System auf ganzer Linie empfehlen. Es macht unglaublich viel Spaß damit loszuziehen und Fotos zu schießen."

I know it is not a full frame camera which for the price the XT4 is you probably should get an Alpha 7 II or some 6D Canon. But i do like the crispiness of the images and the overall quality. I got separately a 18-55 kit lens which fits perfectly for my needs for now.

Just not that unlike other brands the fuji gives you a full range of customisation of your settings with dials for basically anything. The screen is quite handy for taking awkward shots. All in all 5/5 for me."

I took the plunge and purchased this with the 16-80mm kit lens. The learning curve was not steep at all and, looking a few videos on YouTube, i have learned how to just set this camera up and enjoy taking pictures (as a first step). I now shoot exclusively in raw and edit in lightroom and, to be honest, the pictures are stunning. I could never have achieved this sort of quality and skill with my prior set up. It really is next level and transformative. It has changed the way i look at every place i go now with a view of how to best take advantage of this set up that i have.

If you are pondering on whether to get this camera - i would urge you to go for it. You will not be disappointed at all. Look up best initial settings and just get out and enjoy using it. I bought a neck strap and a bag to carry the camera. I've bought a spare battery and the charger but never needed them yet. It is a great camera that i looking forward to spending many years in using."

THE GOOD: This is a very powerful camera with a huge array of features. The shutter is exquisite, quiet and precise. The autofocus is exceptionally quick. It's got an array of tools and options in the menus that other big names don't have. It looks sharp. It's well built. The lens is metal and looks the business.
THE BAD:
1) The image quality was really not where I wanted it to be. I didn't think it was an improvement on my old Nikon D5500, when I opened the images up and zoomed in. It feels like a top-end full-frame mirrorless camera, with all the features you might expect, PLUS IBIS - that's for some reason hampered by that small APS-C sensor.
2) I wanted something more portable than my DLSR, but with the 16-80 zoom on it's not actually much smaller and only a few hundred grams lighter than a full-frame DSLR plus lens.
3) All those features add a fair amount of complexity, and it takes a lot of getting used to and menu-diving before it's where you want it to be.
4) I couldn't get the bridging app to work reliably, it was clunky and didn't want to play (this with a 2020 iPhone).
5) For £1800 it's an expensive proposition for an APS-C sensor, when there are many excellent full-frame options around that price, both DSLR and mirrorless.
I think Fuji's smaller rangefinders offer a lot of the functionality, style and charm – and the 'Fuji look' – for a lot less money. Something like this should be a big step up. It really didn't feel like it to me.
Your mileage may vary, and not everyone needs full frame. It's a nice piece, and it may work for you."

Was mir besonders an der Kamera gefällt, ist wie sie sich anfühlt. Sie sieht gut aus, ist nicht zu groß oder zu schwer, fühlt sich aber trotzdem stabil und hochwertig an - man hat sie einfach gerne in der Hand.

Der Autofokus ist schnell genug und zuverlässig, Augentracking etc. funktioniert sehr gut.

Das Menü ist einfach und übersichtlich aufgebaut und man hat die Möglichkeit sich Zebras, Gitterlinien, Wasserwaage etc einblenden zu lassen.

Aufnahmen sind mit bis zu 60fps in 4K/10bit möglich, 1080p/8bit sogar bis zu 240fps.

Der Bildstabilisator ist in Ordnung. Für meinen Geschmack war er teilweise zu wackelig, vorallem wenn man gegangen ist, sprang er manchmal hin und her. Die Bewegungen wurden stabilisiert, das Bild aber manchmal etwas verzogen.

Beim Color Grading habe ich bei stärkerer Bearbeitung vorallem in den Highlights relativ starkes Banding wahrnehmen können.

Zu den Fotos kann ich wenig sagen, da ich kaum welche gemacht habe.

Es ist keine Profikamera, für Hobbyfoto- und Videografen aber durchaus zu empfehlen."

Wenn es einen Nachteil gegenüber meiner DSLR gibt, dann höchstens der, dass die Kamera einen kurzen Moment nach dem Anschalten braucht, bis das Bild im Sucher erscheint und ich fotografieren kann.

Contra más bicheo la cámara más partido se le saca y la única pega que le pongo es que los 10 bits de color interno se graban en H.265, que tiene problemas de compatibilidad con premiere. La cámara graba internamente a 4:2:0 pero puedes sacar la señal a 4:2:2. Trae ""simulación de película"" interesantes y que, aunque no los use mucho, te sacan de un apuro si vas mal de tiempo y no quieres etalonar. Súper necesaria la doble ranura para tarjetas y una pena que haya que conectar adaptador para ponerle auriculares.
En cuanto a foto, la cámara se defiende muy bien y pesa relativamente poco. Los objetivos son muy pequeños y algo más caros que, por ejemplo, Sony. Pero la calidad es muy buena y crean en conjunto un diseño ""retro"" elegante. También destaco la duración de la batería, que aguanta bastante.
NOTA: En vídeo lo que más me preocupaba era la resistencia del ISO, que me ha sorprendido gratamente en situaciones con poca luz.

Was ich sagen kann ist, daß die Kamera ausgezeichnet verarbeitet ist. Das Design ist funktional und sehr wertig. Das häufig kritisierte Klappdisplay stört mich nicht und ich freue mich sogar über die höhere Beweglichkeit. Die Bildqualität der Kamera ist beeindruckend. Insbesondere im Low Light Bereich, der für mich persönlich ein wichtiger Kaufgrund war. Im Vergleich zu meiner Vorgängerkamera die X-T2 ist auch ISO 3200 noch immer sehr feine Kontraste im Bild erkennbar bei absolut vertretbarem Rauschen. Bei X-T2 war der Qualtitäsverlust eigentlich bereits nicht mehr tragbar. Absolutes Highlight ist das IBIS System. Ich war skeptisch wie gut es in der Praxis ist, aber es hält was es verspricht. Bilder mit dem 90mm f2 bei 1/4s waren frei Hand ohne Probleme verwendbar. Kombiniert mit ISO 3200 kann man die Nacht zum Tage machen, wenn man das denn will. Die Kamera ist also nicht nur optisch schön sondern auch technisch top. Daher verzeihe ich Fuji, daß sie kein externes Ladegerät mehr beigelegt haben sondern nur ein USB-C Kabel zum Laden des Akkus an der Kamera. @Fuji: War das nötig? Sonst alles richtig gemacht."

Consegna puntuale e pacco nuovissimo. La Fujifilm è una garanzia , un piacere per gli occhi e le ghiere sono uno stimolo per neofiti ed esperti. Amore infinito.

Well, Fuji have cheaped out and make you buy a separate charger if, like me, you wish to continue using the camera while charging a battery. Also Fuji do not seem to be making a metal hand grip for the X-T4 as they do for other models, though there are third party grips. Finally, Fuji do not supply the little plastic gubbins with the X-T4 that they have always supplied with other cameras to help you open the strap split rings, I know this is nitpicking!

La recomiendo ampliamente, sobre todo para video. Mi calificación es por el servicio y la atención al cliente. Compre esta cámara hace unas semanas, pero por alguna razón el cargo llego completo a mi tarjeta en lugar de a meses. Llamé a Amazon y la única solución que me dieron fue devolver el artículo y esperar el reembolso, debido a que el cargo ya se había realizado en el banco. Esto me represento un problema porque implico quedarme sin mi herramienta de trabajo.
El proceso de devolución y la restauración de los fondos tardó varios días. Pero al quedar resuelto decidí comprar nuevamente la cámara.
Días después, llegó el paquete. Para mi sorpresa, resulto que era exactamente la misma cámara que yo había devuelto. A pesar de que yo había comprado una cámara nueva.
En cierta forma lo entiendo, ya que en ningún momento devolví el equipo por alguna falla.
Lo que si me parece una falta de respeto es que en ningún momento se me comentara que esto iba a suceder y si estaba de acuerdo con eso. Vaya, no sabía que esto era posible.
Me vi obligado a devolver el equipo, ya que me plantearon que no había otra opción.
Yo cumplí con los requerimientos que Amazon me pidió para hacer la devolución.
Y a final de cuentas, compre un equipo nuevo (porque en ningún momento de la segunda compra se me planteo que fuera usado) y termine con un equipo usado (aunque fuera por mi) pagándolo como nuevo.
No se si en algún momento de la segunda compra, el vendedor supo que era yo quien estaba haciendo la compra de nuevo. Pero no creo que eso sea correcto.
La primera compra debió finalizarse cuando se acepto la devolución de fondos. Y la segunda compra debió ser un proceso completamente diferente e independiente del primero.
Si yo hubiera esperado más tiempo o comprado la cámara con otro vendedor, hubiera terminado con una cámara nueva. Y entonces… ¿Le hubieran mandado esa cámara a alguien diferente?
Yo no hubiera tenido problema de que me reenviaran la misma cámara, pero ni siquiera se tomaron la molesta de avisarme."

Keistler,"Excellent Image Quality, Lightweight for Travel",2022-09-05,"This is not my first micro four thirds camera. I bought the first OMD EM-1 when it came out to use while traveling. So I already had some lenses. At the time, there were only one or two PRO lenses when it came out, so most are everyday lenses. Still, it produced some great images. Since then, my skills have improved and I purchased two full frame Nikons (810 and Z7). I don't think it's reasonable to compare them. Each has different features and excels in different areas. So why did I upgrade the Olympus? Size and portability. I'm not getting any younger. Full size lenses have significantly more weight to them. The fact that a 400 mm Nikkor lens weighs more than multiple Olympus lenses put together, with the same or greater focal length, is becoming more important as I age. Yes, there are differences in their capabilities, but I have to say, the improved image stabilization of the Olympus has been a game changer.

Prior to the improved stabilization, I felt the need to use the larger camera. Most smaller cameras are light enough that it's easy to move the camera while taking the shot. There are many instances when a tripod or monopod isn't permitted or practical to use. The heavier weight of the Nikon (or any full frame camera) was easier to balance. The improved stabilization of the Mark III has changed that. It also improves the quality of low light images significantly.

I should tell you that I am not a professional. I am just an experienced hobbyist. If I were a pay-for-pics pro I would probably choose my Nikon system. I like to explore my own creativity and the Olympus lends itself to that. It's incredibly versatile. Astrophotography? Yes! Soccer games? Yes! Macro? Yes! Vacations? Yes! (and you'll love the way it's sealed for weather and active lifestyles) Landscapes, camping, wildlife, celebrations, life events......it can take on just about anything you can imagine.

There's a lot more than megapixels to cameras. While this one is 20 mp, in high-res mode, it can produce an 80 mp image. That's far more than most of us need. The tech this employs to acheive that level of detail also produces incredible color quality. The battery life is significantly improved from the first iteration, although it still doesn't come close to lasting as long as Nikon batteries. So pick up an extra battery or two.

Overall, I really like using this camera. The best camera to use is the one you have in your hand. That's exactly why most of us love the camera feature in our phones. This camera is packed with features and it's lightweight, compact size makes it easy to keep within reach for all those occasions you'd like to capture."

Buy it, there are no negatives. Certainly proven pro capability and more important quality. More features than even pro's may need. I have several Olympus and Panasonic's with pro glass and use it with my FF Nikon stuff but only to ease lens changes really, in given situations. I have yet to regret an Olympus shot not having been done with the FF Nikon. The M43 glass is unmatched and way better optically and smaller. it is also fun to buy a superpro spec quality lens at one tenth the price of its FF equavalent, go research for yourself comparing for example the 300 (600) mms F4 and then speak to wildlife pros. Especially pro lady photographers love beating the outdated rest in this way. Depth of field is far more practical like bokeh for portraits and deep focus for macro and landscapes. This is a serious tool but Em1Mark ii , EM5 etcetera and Panasonic are equally capable. The way I use it I don't miss focus and iso 6400 noise is not an issue with e.g. Topaz Denoise AI. Heartily recommended buy. Stock up on this and lots of batteries. It is so good, rewarding and fun to use you may never display it as a collector's piece after Olympus divestment. My EM 1Mii convinced me this stuff doesn't break, not even in the rain. And image stabilization is spooky good. Great for blogging, video and especially fotos in good light and those dark entertainment scenarious. Most useful for weddings because you are more mobile than with any other setup bar none. I first bought it as fun stuff to replace the Olympus XZ 1 which lived in my pocket everyday as I had FF stuff for ""serious"" photography. I very quickly changed my definition.

Lusk III,Awesome camera,2020-09-17,"I switched from FT to MFT about 18 months ago with the purchase of an E-M1ii. It's a great camera, but the E-M1iii is an order of magnitude better. Some people may view the E-M1iii as only a minor evolutionary upgrade to the E-M1ii, but I think they are focusing only on the sensor, EVF, and flippy screen being the same and on a few of the little improvements, and are totally missing the bigger picture (two puns intended). In reality, the sum total of the little improvements PLUS the major improvements make the E-M1iii a huge upgrade: faster and newer TruePic processor, USB power and charging, LiveComp extended from 3 hours to 6 hours, better face detect, better IBIS, joystick, rated weather sealing, higher rated shutter, four custom modes and bulb on the dial, MyMenu, handheld high res, LiveND, and the list goes on. The E-M1iii is a fantastic camera to handle and shoot with.

Here are two example images. I wish I had more, but shelter at home and smoke from California's forest fires have mostly kept me from shooting outside. The star trails image is from mid-August (before the fires) and used a Laowa 4.3 mm circular fisheye and 270x30s LiveComp frames, for a total exposure time of 2h15m. The blue and gold macaw is from the local zoo under smoky skies. I used the 40-150 f/2.8 Pro + MC-14 teleconverter + digital zoom. I almost never use the digital zoom, but I wanted to see how this would turn out. It worked just fine, although the digital zoom reduced the effective resolution."

Avila,Phenomenal camera and feature packed!,2020-05-05,"Let me first start off by saying this....this is one bada$$ camera!! I ordered the Em1 Mark III as an upgrade to my Olympus Em10 and Em5 cameras. Before pulling the trigger on this camera, I watched countless reviews and videos on the ins and outs of the em1 mark iii and everything this camera offered was exactly what I was looking for: Fast face/eye autofocus, handheld high res shot, crazy good IBIS, weather proof body, and small/lightweight body. The Olympus does everything I hoped it would and MORE!

Coming from a background with using Nikon APSC and full frame cameras, I also felt that the autofocus was lacking with m43 cameras but this is were the Em1 shines. The camera's AF is so quick, that I can easily capture images of my 2 yr old daughter running around and it will lock onto her eye whenever it gets the chance which is amazing. I could never do that with my older Olympus cameras. The IBIS is down right incredible and I can easily get 4 second handheld shots and the images are sharp!

Before jumping into the M43 world, my favorite camera I have ever owned was the Nikon d5300 due to its smaller size and excellent grip. The Olympus Em1 Mark III reminds me so much of that camera with it's excellent grip and ergonomics yet, being smaller of a camera. I love that the Em1 is just a little bigger than the Em5 which allows me to use my small camera pouches and take the Em1 everywhere. Overall, I am extremely happy with this camera and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade or those that are looking to dive into the M43 world. A++"

They've always emphasized their small form factor, light weight, and outrageously rugged build, and they remain faithful with their OM-D EM-1 Mark III. The image stabilization is jaw-dropping good for hand-held work, but the internal gyro does add a bit of vibration. I'm not a really big fan of lugging around my old Manfrotto 055, it's freakin' heavy even without another 25# of camera and lens, but put Olympus' 300mm F4 lens and 2x teleconverter on this camera, put it on a tripod, turn off the IS to eliminate the last tiny vibration, and use a remote shutter release?

1. I lugged around a Canon DSLR with a set of lenses including a 100 - 400 zoom on Safari in Africa, so was looking for a lighter rig to serve me on long days in the field.
2. My hands are not as steady as they used to be, and Olympus' in-body image stabilization is said to be the best.
3. I was intrigued by the built-in focus bracketing (which permits focus stacking), which I am eager to use for macro work.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to take full advantage of the camera's capabilities in the six weeks that I've had it. Unbelievably, the almost 300 page digital manual for the camera lacks the kind of depth to actually explain how it works. There is almost no mention of focus bracketing/stacking in the manual. To give an example of just how ridiculously shallow the manual is - I was looking up the capacity (mAh) of the battery, and under specs all it said was the model number and that it was a lithium rechargeable. Everything is covered, but just barely. Because the camera is still relatively new, online help in the form of forums etc. remains limited.
Pros:
1. Smaller/lighter body/lenses when compared to a full-size DSLR.
2. ""World best"" image stabilization.
3. Intriguing special features not offered by Canon, Sony, Nikon.
4. Very fast shooting speed.
Cons:
1. Significant compromise in image quality, the result not only of a smaller sensor, but also because it's the same sensor Olympus has been using for many years.
2. Huge digital manual, which none-the-less lacks depth.
3. Bewildering array of interdependent menu items, the organization of which makes absolutely no sense to this mostly Canon user.
4. No built-in flash. (Nor does a flash come with the unit).
5. Persistent rumors that manufacturer's days may be numbered."

There is no ""Auto"" mode! This camera offers both the advantages of the micro 4/3 system (smaller lenses and weather sealing on Pro lens). As such, it is an excellent system for hiking and travel. The Mkiii added a dedicated joy stick, starry skys autofocus, 80 mp handheld option and built in nd capability. All four were welcome additions to the camera. The downsides of the camera is the sensor which is at least 4 years old, low light capability and more limited depth of field. Although I would love a bump in sensor resolution, it is not a deal breaker. The low light limitations can be mitigated by the fast pro lens and excellent third party noise reduction software. The depth of field can also be dealt with in camera with focus stacking. I would still recommend this body even though Olympus has sold its imaging business. The completeness of the micro 4/3 system perfectly fits our needs. Highly recommended."

Lenses that come along: The 7-14, 12-100, and the 45 mm. The combination of live ND, and the amazing IBIS create a kit that is a pleasure to use. I tried to depend on my Sony A7C on a hike but the Lexar memory card died, and all memories were lost; victims of a single card slot. The features of the Mark III and its excellent face/eye tracking make it a pleasure to use. I made a 16-image pano using the 45 mm with outstanding resolution and color. The little effort required produced a result that no UWA lens could replicate. Having three camera systems: Sony, Olympus and early Fuji, there are two cameras I enjoy the most: Olympus OMD EM-1 Mark III, and the Fuji X100F. With very little effort in LRC, it’s possible to produce images that will thrill as social media posts, 11 X 14 and pano prints of any size."

The key features for me and my usage needs are the weather sealing and solid IBIS - I'm often using this camera body in rough outdoor conditions in the wilderness and for industrial job sites where a delicate camera is not ideal. The array of new features I'm having fun exploring so far, and it's restored my passion for using my Olympus gear for personal photography outside the realm of what I mentioned earlier (which is more work-related). Loving the solid feel of the grip still, which has always been a big sell for me using these smaller micro four thirds bodies, compared to my previous Nikon kit that was not friendly when it came to the weight and bulk. I can't wait to be able to travel again and bring this with me to enjoy on vacation."

Picture files from this Olympus are just as sharp and detailed as APS-C or Full Frame files unless you need to print larger than 16x20. I have shown this to be true in prints I regularly sell that are made from all three sensor sizes. When is the Olympus better? When I go out into the mountains and want to carry a body and several lenses, then there is no choice which I will carry. Friends that go with me who carry Full Frame and several lenses always are envious by a couple of miles hiking in. I am in my mid-70s and have been at this photography business for a long time.

The image stabilization just blew me away. Hand held, four second exposures. Extremely sharp image quality. High resolution mode that takes 50 or 80 mega pixel images. Astrophotography mode that can focus on stars. An autofocus that is so quick I had to wonder if I really took a picture the first time I clicked the shutter button. This is the smartest camera on the market and one of the most robust. Easy to carry, an all metal design and has the best weather sealing on the market.

That said, I returned it. A micro four thirds camera will never compete with a full frame sensor when it comes to low light photography. As much as I wanted to grab people and say ""Hey, look at this cool feature"" I didn't do my homework. I thought all f stop ratings were the same, but an f2.8 lens for a micro 4/3 camera is equal to an f5.6 on a full frame camera. It will take a fantastic picture in low light on a tripod, but not if your subject is moving.

I returned the Olympus and picked up a full frame mirrorless camera, but to honest I wish I had both."

The grip really adds to the bulk but it also makes it very wonderful to hold. It was easy to operate right away from knowing the old one although many things are different. I haven't even yet scratched the surface of what more it can do compared to the old one. Bigger processor. Bigger and more useful screen.

My Pelican case with two or three M43 cameras and five lenses weighs half what my Pelican case containing my full frame equipment weighs.

The excellent IBIS means not needing a tripod much of the time. Now is the time to pick these up at the covid influenced low prices. With the improvements in noise reduction software that issue isn't as big a problem as before.

It won't be in depth- but I'll come back and update it after a week or two. Initial impressions are strong. I have owned 4 Oly cameras over the past 10 years and this one has the fastest AF I've ever used. Menus are intuitive. It doesn't come with a robust manual, but just in the first 5 minutes I could use the buttons and such and get it to do what I want it to do. Super menu already set up. Thumb knob to change from MF to AF. Body feels light and plasticy, but its weather sealed, so I'm fine with it. Out of the box first pic with no post production with OLY 25mm 1.2 lens."

Good communication throughout - I was kept informed and all timelines were met in what would be difficult ""Covid"" logistical circumstances. Thank you Becextech.

Along with 3 lenses and I absolutely love it. This camera really performs well if you're doing night photography, mainly because of the superior image stabilization which can give you up to 7 stops of light. I can easily shoot at 1/3 shutter spd hand held, and get clean sharp images without having to raise my ISO. Something that's impossible to do without a tripod for any other camera. Also the Hi res feature mode gives you the ability to take 50mp photos handle held, and 80mp with a tripod! Which is absolutely amazing, considering that it's a 20mp sensor. I highly recommend this camera. And I'm a diehard full frame Sony user."

No regrets on this camera. Perfect for macros and birding. Will be taking on backpacking trips this summer.

Haven't tried Starry Sky AF yet. but I expect it to work as expected, based upon numerous other reviews.

Macro, wildlife, backpacking. Three specialized uses. Most people would use it 100% of the time with no issues.

A wonderful camera and numerous wonderful lenses.

Lower resolution and higher noise than others? Yes, but still very often the best tool for the job."

For audio, I used external condensing stereo microphones and the quality was excellent. I cannot comment on the built-in microphones as I have not used them to-date.

I'd like the size and weight of the camera and the three lenses I bought for it. But there are just too many menus to Wade through every time I wanted to find a setting. So I threw up my hands, sold both cameras and all three lenses, and went back to my old standby, Canon. I bought a Canon R6 mirrorless camera, and I love it. It's well-organized, logical and makes sense. As a professional photographer I know said, this camera was obviously not designed by a photographer. It's not intuitive, and it's extremely complex. I was very disappointed, as I really wanted to like this camera."

After weeks of testing, upgrading from my OM-D E-M5 Mark II has been a great decision, and I would highly recommend this camera. I've attached a few images, including some in low-light settings (under the lights at a soccer match), and the quality of each image more than meets my standards."

the IBIS and autofocus are good, build quality is stellar, on par with the S5 but this camera was near unusable on vacation.
The on screen GUI would suddenly refuse to change shutter speed in manual mode video, had to reset settings in the middle of the night just to shoot anything.
AF setup kept resetting mode.
Low light is so bad that we ended up using the phone through there rest of our journey!

Lewandowski,Great Camera,2021-05-07,"I was using the DA*300mm f4 for the test shots I did here.

I love this camera. It seems very well thought out. Pentax took their time to make sure what they're releasing is a quality product, and I think perhaps some of the things that could use a little improvement are exactly the kinds of things that firmware updates can address. When trying out a camera the grip isn't something I usually think about because I assume it will feel ""quirky"" in some way or other, and that I'll just ""get use to it,"" as if it was made for some other hands. Not so with this camera. I found it immediately comfortable. I wasn't sure if I would like the touch screen, but I now see how useful they've made it. I love it. Also with the few tests I've done they've really hugely improved upon immediate transfer of images (even RAW) to a smartphone. The auto-focus is excellent. As expected, it's a super solid build. It's not silent like a mirrorless, but I think this is the first DSLR where the sound of the shutter was soft enough where birds aren't startled right at go. The menu takes a little getting use to as it's changed quite a bit, but there's nothing I haven't searched for that I didn't find with occasional use of the provided manual.

Is it worth the price tag? For me it was. I have a bunch of Pentax lenses already and I wasn't going to wait six months for the price to maybe come down to try this out. Now that I have it I won't be returning it. :)"

There are lot of reviews about this product. So, I will not repeat mostly.

* Good camera for personal use. I not a professional. So I can't comment on that.
* Compact and feels very sturdy.
* Very good autofocus (with fast eye detection).
* Easy to use. I did not read any manual.
* Too many options to explore. I was using an old Sony DSLR. So the menu system was a bit overwhelming.
* Very good quality pictures and videos.
* EVF is good.

It did not come with a charger. But it was good for me as I had few good quality USB type C adapters.

Let me talk about delivery. I was a bit skeptical about the delivery as this is the first time I am ordering an item with this price from an online store.

As usual, the item was well packaged with proper security measures to avoid theft and tampering. Before opening I observed that the box was not in perfect shape. So, I took a video of unboxing to use as evidence if something is wrong inside. But that was not the case. When I removed the external cover, I could see that it came with a bag (surprise...), which was making it as odd shape. But otherwise camera was in a well sealed box. It also had one memory card. The listing did not mention bag and card. So, I got two extra items. A bag and a card."

From a value for money perspective, I think this camera has no competition in the market if you try to find a feature to feature match for this price. From a cost to performance perspective it gets even better. This is a very capable camera. In a few days that I have spent with it, I have found myself pleasantly surprised multiple times by the quality of images that it produces and I am not even talking about the quality of raw files here. I know that relying on SOOC JPEGs may not be a feasible option for a lot of people. However I think if you are so inclined, this is the camera that fits the bill. This is a fairly advanced camera and it is heavily customizable. And although it is very easy to get your photos out of it and into a smartphone, you can't expect the workflow to be the same as a smartphone camera. But then again, the image quality you get is light years ahead of what the best smartphone cameras can do. I bought it without the kit lens and paired it with the cheap xc35mm f2 prime and so far I'm loving it."

Most of the pics captured were out of focus. Need to be extra cautious while taking pics. If u don't need flip screen, better to go with XT3. XT3 has weather sealing and great view finder and good screen. Lenses are expensive. Try to buy 16-80 it covers more needs than 18-55. For someone coming from smartphone, there is learning curve. Also be ready to spend lot of money on lens. At least on zoom and one wide angle are needed in addition to kit lens. Picture quality is good, but we need to know how to use it. If you are a casual user/traveller, just go with Iphone 13, which very easy to carry, always with us. Phone is portable, user friendly, everything will be in focus, easy to share pics and save. No need to carry a huge camera bag with charger, camera body, 2 lens, extra memory card, cable to transfer pics. I did 2 trips with this camera, it was hell of experience. Also, we can't take some help from other to click a pic for us, as it needs some expertise. Also, Iphone/any phone covers a lot of focal lengths, this camera is limited to 18mm that too with f2.8, which is not great. f1.4 lens is great for picture quality. They are very expensive.
In short, camera is not required for casual users. Carry lens and changing lens is big issue."

The feel is superb, the grip perfect and overall balanced.
The pictures are sharp, focus is above average. It keeps springing surprises when you try to be adventurous, it never disappoints you. It is always ready whenever you are. The battery drains relatively fast as compared to a DSLR, but a beast of such magnitude would require that much power.
Overall a great package."

Confronto dettagliato con reflex, full frame e altre marche",2021-11-06,"Prima di questa macchina fotografica avevo una Nikon D5000 con obiettivo 35mm f 1.8, ossia una reflex APS-C CMOS del 2009. Pe quanto possa sembrare scontato che in tutti questi anni ci siano stati enormi miglioramenti, anche la mia vecchia Nikon scattava ottime foto e la qualità dell'immagine in generale è stato l'ultimo punto che mi ha spinto a fare questo passaggio. In questa recensione voglio quindi spiegare cosa cambia e cosa offre questa Fujifilm X-S10 e a chi è rivolta.

PARTE 1: DIFFERENZA generica tra REFLEX e MIRRORLESS:
Mirrorless = senza specchio, ossia senza lo specchio davanti al sensore che nelle reflex manda l'immagine verso l'alto al mirino ottico. A parte questo, proprio come le Reflex, anche le Mirrorles consentono di avere ottiche intercambiabili.

DIMENSIONI: l'assenza dello specchio permette dimensioni ridotte sia del corpo macchina, che delle ottiche. Con l'ottica giusta (tipo il mio FUJINON XF 27 mm f2.8), questa macchina sta tranquillamente nella tasca di un giubbotto o nella taschina degli zaini solitamente riservata a occhiali da sole e altre piccole cose. Sicuramente l'altra ottica che ho scelto, il 16-80, non va affatto in questa direzione essendo una delle più grandi, ma il 18-55 f2.8 che si può scegliere come alternativa è a mio avviso un ottimo compromesso essendo piccolissimo e offrendo una qualità ottica decisamente superiore ai classici 18-55 kit (basti pensare che l'apertura di partenza è f.2.8 e non 3.5). Per farsi un'idea delle dimensioni allego delle foto comparative.

AUTOFOCUS: Poichè il sensore è costantemente attivo (nelle reflex viene attivato solo quando lo specchio si alza quando si scatta la foto) consente un autofocus sia più preciso che più rapido. Ad esempio, questa Fuji riesce a individuare i volti, a regolare l'esposizione in modo ottimale per questi e a mettere a fuoco automaticamente sugli occhi, tutte cose che sulle reflex erano possibili solo in modalità Live View (solo sul display, mentre qui anche sul mirino) e con notevole perdita delle prestazioni (la mia Nikon impiegava addirittura 10 o più secondi a mettere a fuoco in modalità live View e anche lo scatto non era immediato).
Infine, segnalo che questa Fuji riesce a mettere a fuoco anche in condizioni di pessima illuminazione (addirittura -6 stop) e in generale è molto molto più rapida a mettere a fuoco.

ANTEPRIMA ESPOSIZONE: Sempre per il motivo che il sensore è sempre attivo, è possibile visualizzare direttamente sul display o sul mirino un'anteprima dell'esposizione dell'immagine sulla base dei parametri impostati. Ciò era possibile anche su alcune reflex (non sulla mia) ma, come per l'autofocus sui volti, solo in modalità live View con tutte le conseguenze già dette al punto precedente. Senza di ciò ci si doveva basare solo sulle indicazioni dell'esposimetro (la lineetta con i + e i - in basso), il che ovviamente si riferiva solo a un singolo punto dell'immagine e non consentiva di farsi un'idea su tutto il resto della foto (si doveva andare a tentativi). Così l'esperienza è simile a quella che si ha con uno smartphone.

MIRINO OLED: per quanto l'immagine che si apprezza nelle reflex direttamente riflessa dallo specchio sia stata a lungo considerata superiore, la qualità dei mirini OLED attuali non fa rimpiangere ed anzi segna un altro puto a favore delle mirrorless (e di questa Fuji): non solo la qualità è ottima, grazia sia all'altissima risoluzione dello schermino del mirino sia al fatto che sia oled e che quindi abbia contrasti perfetti con neri assoluti (e non grigi), ma anche è possibile apprezzare sul mirino funzioni altrimenti relegate solo al display (come l'anteprima dell'esposizione, del bilanciamento del bianco, del profilo colore, dell'HDR e altro).

CONTRO: Batteria. sicuramente il fatto che sensore e display/mirino siano sempre accesi comporta dei consumi molto maggiori. Con la mia reflex non avevo mai sentito la necessità di una seconda batteria, mentre con questa può essere necessario se si prospetta di dover scattare molte foto (per viaggi o giornate normali invece si arriva tranquillamente a sera con carica residua). Comodo a tal proposito che la ricarica avvenga (anche) via USB-C (senza dover rimuovere la batteria), con lo stesso caricabatterie del cellulare (una cosa in meno da portarsi in viaggio) e che si possa ricaricare anche con una powerbank e usarla contemporaneamente (utile se ad esempio non si dispone di una seconda batteria).

PARTE 2: DIFFERENZA GENERICA TRA APS-C E FULL-FRAME O MICRO 4:3
DIMENSIONI: Anche in questo caso, a parità di tipologia (mirrroless), le APS-C sono più piccole delle FULL-Frame sia per quanto riguarda il corpo macchina che le ottiche. In generale le ritengo un giusto compromesso tra full-frame (sensore più grande, dimensioni maggiori) e micro 4:3 (sensore più piccolo e dimensioni ancora inferiori).

OTTICHE: Le ottiche APS-C sono generalmente più piccole e molto meno costose, tuttavia, è opportuno ricordare che la quantità di sfocato che viene generato da aperture molto luminose è ridotta e va convertita con un indice di 1:1,5. Mi spiego meglio, il livello di sfocato che si otterrà con un’ottica APS-C f. 1.8 è lo stesso che si otterrebbe con un’ottica per full-frame di focale equivalente f. 1.8 x 1,5 = 2,7 ≈ f 2.8, quindi per il processo inverso se si vuole ottenere uno sfocato (bokeh) pari a un 2.8 full frame, su una fotocamera APS-C si deve optare per un obiettivo f. 1.8. Ad ogni modo, l’APS-C è il giusto mezzo tra full frame e macchine fotografiche con sensori più piccoli (in cui questo discorso è ancora più accentuato).
Infine ricordo che per calcolare la focale full frame equivalente anche in questo caso si deve moltiplicare per 1.5 (quindi un’ottica APS-C 35mm è all’incirca pari a un 50 mm full frame come angolo di campo dell’inquadratura).

COSTO: a parità di caratteristiche, le APS-C costano in genere anche 1000 o più euro in meno di una full frame. Infatti, per comprare una Full frame completa di tutte le caratteristiche che questa Fuji X-S10 offre si devono scomodare modelli professionali da 2-3.000€, senza contare il costo delle ottiche, molto maggiore per le full frame. Lo ripeto ancora una volta, le APS-C mi sembrano il giusto compromesso tra costo e qualità offerta.

ISO / LUCE: va detto che un sensore più piccolo significa necessariamente meno luce che entra. Tuttavia, questa macchina fotografica regge davvero davvero bene gli iso anche alti, il che insieme alla stabilizzazione su sensore (che permette di alzare i tempi di esposizione anche a mano libera) permette di compensare senza grossi problemi la minore luce che entra. Anche quando gli iso si fanno davvero alti, la grana che si aggiunge è piacevole rispetto ad altre macchine e, poichè si hanno a disposizione 26 MP, alla fine dà poco fastidio.

PARTE 3: PERCHE' proprio FUJIFILM?
SENSORE APS-C XTRANS: Mentre Sony, Nikon, Canon, etc... si concentravano sulle mirrorless full-frame, Fujifilm ha lanciato già da molti anni le sue mirorrless e SOLO nel formato APS-C, dedicando quindi molta più attenzione delle altre già citate case, che hanno rilasciato le loro prime mirrorless APS-C solo di recente.
Inoltre, a differenza dei sensori di praticamente qualsiasi altra macchina fotografica, che sfruttano lo schema Bayer, i sensori Fujifilm proprietari sfruttano un loro schema XTRANS. Questo oltre ad avere rilevanza da un punto di vista della rappresentazione dei colori (vedi dopo), elimina la necessità di avere un filtro passa basso, che nei sensori con schemi Bayer è invece necessario perché previene la formazione di artefatti ma che di fatto riduce la nitidezza delle immagini. Preciso infine anche qui che questo sensore (retroilluminato) regge benissimo gli iso e permette foto ottime anche con poca luce.

STABILIZZAZIONE a livello di SENSORE: oltre alla stabilizzazione ottica presente su numerose ottiche, questa piccola Fuji (già perché di solito è presente in fotocamere più grandi e costose) presenta al suo interno una stabilizzazione anche a livello di sensore.
Nelle ottiche in cui è già presente una stabilizzazione, questo ulteriore stabilizzatore si somma e migliora ulteriormente la capacità di annullare le vibrazioni. Nelle ottiche in cui non lo è inoltre offre un vantaggio ancora più notevole.
Rispetto alla singola stabilizzazione ottica presente sugli obiettivi, comunque, questo genere di stabilizzazione è più rapida e precisa e consente di “guadagnare” fino a 6 stop, che non sono affatto pochi; questo significa che si possono usare tempi di posa a mano libera fino a 6 volte maggiori senza che le foto vengano mosse, un gran vantaggio che ho avuto modo di apprezzare in questi mesi.

COLORI: caratteristica peculiare ormai rinomata di Fujifilm. Non solo la resa dei colori è in generale ottima, ma questa macchina fotografica permette di scegliere tra di preset chiamati “simulazione pellicola” che davvero rappresentano un bel valore aggiunto. I miei preferiti sono “classic Chrome”, che dà un aspetto leggermente vintage davvero bello, “astia”, molto morbido e tenue, perfetto peri i ritratti (vedi foto del gatto e del cane), “velvia”, molto saturo, ideale per i paesaggi e la natura (vedi foto delle case sul Ticino e del fiume in mezzo alla gola) e lo standard “provia” (vedi Matera in notturna); belli anche “eterna”, che ha dato un look molto cinematografico ai miei scatti a Matera e “classic negative”, che riproduce i colori delle classiche foto fatte a rullino (vedi foto con ragazza e bambino sugli scogli). Bellissimo b/n con “acros” infine.
Grazie a questa eccellente elaborazione dei JPEG e a questi profili colore (che possono anche essere personalizzati a proprio piacimento), questa Fuji elabora dei JPEG praticamente già pronti, caratteristica non da poco che consente di non dover trascorrere ore ed ore ad elaborare i file raw come sarebbe necessario fare con altre macchine fotografiche.

INTERFACCIA UTENTE: rispetto ad altre macchine (in particolare le Sony), i menù sono ben organizzati. Inoltre sono presenti numerosi controlli virtuali, tasti fisici e ghiere, tutti personalizzabili in base alle proprie esigenze e preferenze, e in generale l’ergonomia di questa macchina fotografica è ottima, sia da un punto di vista di tenerla in mano (altre Fuji peccavano in questo a favore di un aspetto più retò) sia in termini di controlli. Rispetto ad altre Fuji (X-T30, X-T4) ha perso la possibilità di premere le ghiere per fare switch tra le varie funzioni assegnate, ma non ne ho mai vista l’esigenza in quanto i nuovi controlli PASM (senza ghiera dei tempI) sono ben organizzate e tutti i controlli sono sempre a portata di mano. Ho prezzato tantissimo la presenza di una ghiera dedicata alla compensazione dell’esposizione, cosa ormai presente in tutte le fotocamere ma che la mia vecchia Nikon non aveva e mi costringeva a muovermi tra mille controlli per regolare una funzione così fondamentale.
Utile poi la presenza del menù Q, dove si possono scegliere fino a 16 impostazioni da avere a portata di mano, e il fatto che i controlli assegnati a ghiere e pulsanti possano essere regolati osservando il cambiamento in diretta mentre ci si muove tra le varie opzioni perché non ostruiscono lo schermo (utile per il bilanciamento del bianco e per la simulazione pellicola sopratutto).

ESTETICA: per quanto meno retrò rispetto ad altri modelli della casa per via dell’assenza della ghiera dei tempi, anche lei conserva un aspetto decisamente retrò quando abbinata ad obiettivi quali il mio 27mm f2.8, mentre al contrario appare decisamente professionale e più moderna quando abbinata al 16-80 f4.0. Personalmente, da un punto di vista estetico non mi piaceva in foto quando paragonata ad esempio alla X-T30, anche per via della presenza di un’unica colorazione (non è disponibile il caratteristico bicolore argento o argento scuro); mi sono però ricreduto dal vivo, in quanto appare decisamente più bella. Ricordo che il materiale è metallico, anzichè plastico, del corpo proprio come degli obiettivi (serie XF, mentre gli XC sono in plastica).

COSTO: Obiettivamente la migliore da un punto di vista qualità prezzo; la sua concorrente, la Sony alpha 6600, ossia un’altra mirrorless con sensore APS-C stabilizzato e caratteristiche simili (per quanto in vari aspetti inferiori) costa sui 500€ in più. In generale una differenza di prezzo così ampia non si apprezza sul resto della gamma Fujifilm.

OTTICHE: le ottiche Fuji sono di ottima qualità e sicuramente non ne rimarrete delusi (come non ne sono rimaso deluso io). In generale consiglio uno zoom variabile tra il 18-55 f.2.8 e il 16-80 f.4, a seconda del budget, e un fisso sui 35mm quale ad esempio il Fuji XC 35mm f2.0 che vale assolutamente i 200€ che costa ed è tutto sommato compatto. Se non avete mai usato ottiche fisse (e in generqale un 35mm APSC, ossia un 50 mm equivalente) in passato vi consiglio caldamente di provare: per quanto all’invio possa sembrare scomodo non poter variare focale e soprattutto questa focale (50mm equivalente), appena prenderete l’abitudine le vostre foto raggiungeranno un livello totalmente nuovo. Infine, molto compatto, ottimo otticamente e dall’aspetto retrò il 27 mm f2.8 che vedete in foto. Fujifilm ha aperto ad ottiche di terze parti solo da poco, quindi in generale non ce ne sono molte (segnalo a tal proposito le Viltrox) ma al gamma Fujifilm è davvero completa e il fatto che, come dicevo prima, Fuji si sia concentrata primariamente sulle APS-C (e non sulle full frame, come altre case) fa si che ci siano obiettivi per tutte le necessita (e portafogli).

PARTE 4: ALTRO
DISPLAY: per quanto sia spesso sottovalutato, mi sono reso conto con la mia vecchia Nikon (che aveva un pessimo display in quanto risoluzione) quanto importante possa essere il display di una fotocamera; infatti, diventa difficile rendersi conto se una foto è venuta bene o male con un display scarso, non accorgendosi persino se una foto è fuori fuoco o meno. La risoluzione del display di questa Fuji, con i suoi 1,04 milioni di pixel, si colloca al di sopra di molte mirrorless fullframe (tipo Sony Alpha 7 III e la concorrenza APS-C di Nikon e Canon, che ne hanno in genere sui 900 mila), per quanto non sia ai vertici (la sorella XT-4 e la XT-30 Mark II ne hanno 1.6 milioni). Ad ogni modo, questo display è ottimo per risoluzione, resa cromatica e angolo di visuale, ed è pure orientabile (il che è utile in molte situazioni). Personalmente, data la mia brutta esperienza di questi anni con il display della Nikon, mi ero imposto di non comprare nessuna nuova fotocamera con display con meno di 1 milione di punti.

DIMENSIONI FILE, FORMATI: È possibile scattare sia in RAW che in JPEG che in entrambi allo stesso tempo. Inoltre è possibile scegliere se si preferiscono RAW compressi o non e se si preferisce una compressione senza perdita o maggiore (i RAW compressi non sono supportati da molti software e necessitano preferibilmente di Capture One, quello fornito in dotazione, ma consumano meno spazio). Il Mac e l'iPhone sono compatibili nativamente con i Raw di questa X-S10 solo se non compressi, altrimenti consiglio di usare Capture One oppure RAW Power, che da un po' supporta anche i file compressi, supporta i profili colore delle simulazioni pellicola ufficiali ed è disponibile come acquisto una tantum (non abbonamento come Lightroom o photoshop) sia per Mac (39€) sia per iPhone/iPad (10€).
Un file JPEG alla massima risoluzione occupa sui 12-15 MB, mentre per un RAW passiamo a circa 50MB a foto.

MANUALE: ho apprezzato il manuale (in italiano), disponibile in formato digitale sia pdf sia interattivo, in quanto davvero completo. Inoltre, Fujifilm rilascia piccole integrazioni per le funzioni aggiunte con gli aggiornamenti firmware successivi alla pubblicazione del manuale pdf. Il cartaceo non è presente, ma non lo rimpiango in quanto la versione interattiva può essere consultata dal cellulare in ogni momento e in modo più agevole.

FLASH INTEGRATO: piccolo, ma utile in alcune circostanze. Rispetto a quello che avevo nella mia Nikon è più esile, ma è comunque efficace in alcune situazioni (per quanto non ami la fotografia con flash).

ACCESSORI CONSIGLIATI: Io ho comprato il caro, ma utile, kit di Peak Design per convertire la tracolla inclusa (in pelle, nera, carina) e poterla staccare quando voglio usare la maniglia (sempre Peak Design, visibile in foto) o non voglio niente attaccato (utile se voglio ridurre al minimo l'ingombro). Si trovano entrambi su amazon, ma vi consiglio di guardare anche sul sito di Peak Design perché nel mio caso il prezzo pure includendo le spese di spedizione era inferiore. Inoltre consiglio un proteggi schermo qualsiasi in vetro fatto apposta per Fuji X-S10 (per quanto il display possa essere chiuso e protetto talvolta è utile lasciato aperto e graffiarlo sarebbe un peccato). Io uso poi un lettore di schede SD per il cellulare (iPhone, nel mio caso) per passare le foto en plein d'air perché l'app è davvero lenta, mentre cosi in qualche secondo si passano centinaia di foto. Consiglio infine il treppiedi piccolo e portatile JOBY GorillaPod 1K.

APP/GEOTAG FOTO: per quanto l'applicazione sia recensita molto male e il passaggio delle foto al cellulare sia piuttosto lento e in generale scomodo, volevo la presenza di un’interfaccia con il cellulare principalmente per assegnare la posizione alle alle foto (geotag), proprio come avviene quando scatto una foto con il cellulare, e questo avviene piuttosto bene con l’app. Con il mio nuovo iPhone 13 Pro la fotocamera si collega ed apre l'app in background per ottenere la posizione automaticamente, anche se l'app non viene aperta da molto tempo. Con il mio vecchio iPhone, o in generale nel caso in cui non dovesse collegarsi alla fotocamera in automatico, basterà aprire l'app sul cellulare a inizio giornata e poi il processo funziona tranquillamente senza problemi. Non ho notato rilevanti consumi di batteria sul cellulare e comodo che sincronizzi anche l'orario per averlo sempre preciso. In generale la fotocamera non chiede la posizione al cellulare per ogni foto, ma solo ogni tot di tempo.

Spero di aver chiarito ogni possibile dubbio e che questa recensione vi sia stata utile!"

When I saw the press-release of this X-S10 and read a few of the initial reviews, I was pretty sure I had found my new camera and camera system.

While my Canon DSLR was good - it was starting to show its age and I reached a point in my photography where I felt that I ""needed"" something different to improve and inspire me to get back out there and click that shutter. I travel a lot (or used to pre-COVID but will hopefully start again next year) so I liked the idea of a more compact mirrorless camera. Aside from travel photography my main interests are usually wildlife and cityscape/street so again a less obvious camera/lens setup would be helpful. I had never really considered a Fujifilm before the X-S10 as all those dials on top and endless buttons and labels on different models seemed confusing and a bit over the top. Sorry to all Fujifilm lovers who adore those things, just for me it stopped my making the leap before now. I imagine this new camera will divide users on whether or not this is a ""proper"" Fujifilm because of the different approach to design and button layout, but it was enough to make me jump ship so it might bring others to the Fujifilm family.

From out the box, using and becoming familiar with the S10 was a bit difficult. I have no point of comparison from older Fujifilm models to this one (as I mentioned its my first) but it is definitely very different from Canon. The menu system is more complex, with a lot more options and pages upon pages to get to grips with. There is nothing wrong with this - I doubt that previous FF users will have any difficultly but there will be a bit of a learning curve for others. I was glad the PSAM dial was there to help me out (used AUTO for a while to get to grips with the camera. I was pleased to find the four custom options as well as the customisable left and right dial (for the moment I've left them as default). While I didn't like it at first, I have found after a week that the ""joystick"" to navigate the screen is better than a D-pad (which I was used to) and is very responsive.

Build quality is high as you would expect at this price point and I was surprised with both the display quality of the eye piece and from the LCD screen. The layout of the screen is good but I would recommend you go into settings and somewhere (as I can't remember where) there is a option to increase the size of the icons and information displays on the screen (which was helpful). The camera is compact (owing to the system) but fits in the hand well. It does feel just a bit smaller than it should be (if that makes sense) but I imagine I will get used to it. The grip on the right is deep and the perfect size to be comfortable to hold and operate the camera for long periods.

I have a few issues with the design, I don't know how common they are to FF cameras. Firstly I found it strange to have the SD card slot in the same compartment as the battery. I don't know why but it just ""annoys"" me a bit, I suppose because I am used to having separate compartments. I have no problem with a single card SD slot but I was a bit disappointed to find it only supports UHS-1 memory cards. I have had other cheaper models that supported the faster cards. Personally I have not found (yet) that it affects photography or video in any negative way (even 4K records perfectly) so you could argue that its not needed. One thing that WAS a problem and will take a lot to get used to is that small on/off switch. Is it just me or is that really small? It's also not the easiest to turn on and off especially if you have large (or cold) fingers.

I was worried about what I had heard about the ""poor battery life"" from reading about the camera elsewhere, however I would say battery life is reasonable. They don't last as long as my previous canon's but considering they are smaller I would say it was a reasonable trade-off. Bottom line is that you are going to need at least one spare if you plan on being out all day or doing something shutter intensive (such as a wedding) but you are not going to need the ""loads"" that some reviewers have suggested elsewhere. An great advantage is that the battery can be charged in camera via a USB-C cable. You can charge your battery from a laptop, a power-bank or by plugging the cable into a USB-A plug. The camera does not come with a external charger as such, I believe that is the right choice to keeps things light and compact, but if you want to charge your batteries from the mains (or plan on buying multiple) then you can buy a charger easily (and cheaply) enough. For your reference I spent a day (and most of the night) shooting in Edinburgh zoo and the city centre - exhausted one battery and didn't take much out the second (less than half). Plus it was pretty cool being able to connect it to my power bank to charge on the go.

I have been extremely happy with the image quality even straight from the memory card. I'm using the XF18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM and the XF55-200mm F3.5-4.8 R LM - they are both stunning! While they may seem a bit expensive (considering a 50-200mmm lens is available for half the cost) they are really worth the money. Eventually I will get a Prime or two but at the moment my credit card is full enough. I've enclosed a few examples of the quality achieved out-of-camera from Edinburgh Zoo (still working on my city-centre images). Overall I have been pleased with what I have been able to achieve in a short time, I'm a sure more seasoned FF users would have even more luck.

This model has in body stabilization which is a welcome addition under the one-thousand pound mark. So far I feel it works very well and is very close in operation in comparison to more expensive models.

I've taken a few videos (shutting in 4K at 29.9fps and 200Mb frame-rate) and have been happy with the results. I'm not a massive vlogger or video-shooter but there are plenty of video options (pages and pages) to keep you happy.

The cost of this camera seems about right, personally I would have loved it to be a bit cheaper but I'm sure most of us can say that about most things. For the price you get great build quality and brilliant images with plenty of options and settings to play with. I also have to conclude that the Fujifilm lens system (and options) are much better than what I have had in the past.

If I was asked to review this six months down the line when I've had a lot more experience I maybe more inclined to award 5-stars. For the moment I feel there are a few ""strange"" design quirks such as the small on/off switch, the same memory/battery compartment, lack of UHS-II+ cards and so forth. All of which just makes it fall a tiny bit short. Don't get me wrong, this is still a brilliant camera that is very capable. I hope it appeals to both current FF users and people like me who jumped-ship.

The S10 is a better camera with better lenses than my canon set-up. The cost of this camera and my two lenses works out at about three hundred pound more expensive than my canon and twin lens kit set up was. For what you are getting in return from the S10, that's not bad at all. For me I look forward to getting to use it more (more importantly learning to use it more) and getting back to travelling with a more compact system."

I miei:
Pro: il notevole pacchetto di programmi gratuiti compresi (quello per importare le immagini, per rendere la macchina una webcam e soprattutto la versione base di Capture One, che - anche se non è neanche lontanamente paragonabile alla versione piena, a pagamento - è molto utile e potrebbe risparmiare l'acquisto di altri programmi di fotoritocco e/o gestione e archiviazione di immagini).

Firmware aggiornato.
Contro:
Una cosa su cui Fujifilm invece lascia un po' perplessi è che non inserisce nel pacchetto la slitta in plastica per proteggere l'attacco del flash...se gli costa 5 centesimi è molto!..

Non esiste una custodia originale.

Il manuale di istruzioni è in italiano ma nella versione base. Se lo volete scaricare completo sappiate che esiste in italiano, ma che la pagina parte dalla versione multilingue e poi vi rimanda alla pagina in cui, in alto a destra, potete scegliere tra tutte le lingue, italiano compreso.

Superbe appareil photo et très bon objectif avec une grande plage focale (équivalent 24-120mm en plein format). L'appareil est compact et léger (c'était mon premier critère en APSC), d'une construction très robuste. Il n'est pas tropicalisé mais j'ai vu une vidéo d'un canadien qui le laisse toute une nuit dehors sous la neige et le récupère le matin totalement fonctionnel (expérience que je ne vais pas réaliser).

Mon dernier appareil photo à objectif interchangeable était un argentique, un Canon EOS 1 ….(appareil professionnel presque 2kg avec son booster !... auquel il fallait ajouter des objectifs de la série L très lourds et chers) il y a presque 30 ans ! … quelle évolution, quelle légèreté et quelle facilité d'emploi comparé à l'argentique (je faisais mes développement photo chez moi à l'époque).

Le fait d'avoir un appareil sans miroir permet d'avoir le résultat de la photo dès le moment de la prise de vue, y compris l'incidence de l'expo, l'ISO, de l'ouverture, des effets films, etc …. directement sur l'écran ou dans le viseur avant même de déclencher.
Lorsque j'utilisais mon EOS1 argentique j'avais le résultat après avoir développé mes tirages, et c'est là que je voyais mes surexpositions, sous expositions, flou etc… cela me coutait cher en pédicule mais aussi en temps pour développer mes négatifs (les ratés).

Les simulations de films Fuji sont un énorme plus par rapport à d'autres marques. La stabilisation fonctionne parfaitement bien…c'est même plutôt bluffant, mais autant que sur ma GoPro Hero 11 qui est extraordinaire en stabilisation.

Autre avantage qui n'existe pas chez les autres constructeurs d'appareil photo numérique, le capteur Fuji est dépourvu de matrice de Bayer et donc d'un filtre passe-bas (qui diminue le piqué des photos pour compenser les imperfections dûes à la matrice de Bayer).

Pour l'instant je n'utilise même pas 10% des capacités de l'appareil mais je progresse car les réglages sont nombreux et permettent d'individualiser les commandes et de paramétrer facilement toutes les fonctions.

Achats complémentaires :
J'ai ajouté le dernier Fuji 23mm f1.4 R LM WR que j'ai obtenu avec une réduction de 300€ (sur Amazon), mais aussi 2 filtres neutres Fuji (sur Amazon) pour protéger les objectifs, ainsi que 2 filtres d'objectif NEEWER (sur Amazon) de densité 1000, 1 filtre infrarouge (Hoya IRR7272 sur Amazon), 2 batteries + chargeur Baxxtar Pro (sur Amazon), une dragonne en cuir Jachauer (sur Amazon), une plaque de dégagement rapide type Arca-Swiss (Harwerrel 40mm sur Amazon) pour un trépied en carbone K&F Concept (BA225), des protections étanche (OP/Tech USA 9001022 sur Amazon) pour l'appareil et un objectif, 1 Cache Griffe de flash (JJC sur Amazon), 1 film de protection d'écran en verre trempé (ULBTER sur Amazon). Cela commence à faire cher mais je pense être tranquille pour quelques temps."

Die ersten Fotos sahen ziemlich gut aus, trotzdem lag die Kamera danach fast ein Jahr im Schrank. 2022 ging sie dann mit auf eine Safari in Namibia, erwies sich aber naturgemäß nur als mäßig nützlich mit der viel zu ""kurzen"" Kitlinse. Bei einem weiteren Trip nach Afrika machte ich dann alle Fotos mit meinem Pixel 7 Pro. Auf dem Handy-Display sahen die auch richtig gut aus, auf meinem 27"" 5K iMac Display dann aber weniger. Also musste beim nächsten Trip erneut die X-S10 wieder mit, diesmal mit dem längeren 18-135mm Objektiv. Mit dieser Kombination gelangen mir sehr viele sehr schöne Fotos, an die kein Handy auch nur annähernd herankommt (ich habe auch noch ein iPhone 14 Pro Max).

Nun habe ich meine H1 verkauft und mir die X-S10 zugelegt, weil sie von wichtigsten Parametern, die man zum Fotografieren braucht der T4 durchaus gewachsen ist. Was den ganzen Rest betrifft, kann sie der aber nicht das Wasser reichen.
wie gesagt hat sie den AF von der T4, die Bildqualität und auch den Sensor.

Ist sie etwas für den Umsteiger von einem anderen Systems?

Ja, weil es eine spitzenmäßige Kamera ist und Nein !, weil man sich damit genauso beschäftigen muss, wie mit jeder anderen Kamera, um sie bedienen zu können. Ein Wahlrad von S, A, M ist zwar neu bei Fuji reicht aber nicht, um damit reibungslos zu arbeiten. Für den Fuji Nutzer wird das Ganze schon etwas einfacher, weil das Menü nahezu identisch ist im Verhältnis zu anderen Fuji Kameras.
Wie gesagt: Man bekommt eine Spitzen Kamera zum Spitzen Preis und damit muss man sich beschäftigen, um alles aus ihr herauszuholen.

Reicht der alte Akku oder wäre ein neuer besser gewesen?

Für meine Verhältnisse reicht der Akku und schön ist, dass man bei allen Fujis diesen Akku verwenden kann, außer bei der T4.
Der Akku reicht bei mir für 300-400 Bilder und die zwei Sekunden um ihn zu wechseln, kann man ja immer haben.
Ein Zweitakku ist aber Pflicht, wie bei jeder anderen Kamera auch. ich nutze die von Patona und bin damit sehr zufrieden. (kosten um die 10 Euro)

Macht es viel aus, wenn die Kamera nicht wie die T4 wetterfest ist?

Eigentlich nicht und es gibt für alle die gern im strömenden Regen fotografieren geeignete Raincover von zig Anbietern, im Notfall tut es auch einmal eine Plastiktüte. Die T4 ist zwar wetterfest, aber kostet auch 800 Euro mehr. Wer also aus vielen anderen Gründen lieber eine X-S10 möchte, sollte dieses Kriterium nicht berücksichtigen.

Die berühmten Customeinstellungen C1 bis C4, sind sie hilfreich?

Mit den C1 bis C4 Einstellungen, die man über das Wahlrad oben ansteuern kann, hat man die Möglichkeit sich für bestimmte Aufnahmesituationen Voreinstellungen zu konfigurieren.
Beispiel: Ich will ein Portrait machen lege diese Einstellung auf C1... jetzt kann ich für diese Art Foto alles vorher festlegen, von der AF Art, über Kontraste, Weißabgleich, Filmsimulation usw... bis in die absolute Tiefe des Menüs.
Steht ein Portrait an, dann stelle ich auf C1 und fertig. Schön wär 's.
Ich habe die Erfahrung gemacht, dass einem (besser gesagt mir) dieser Kram eigentlich gar nichts nützt, weil es erstens meist nicht hinhaut und man zweitens nicht mehr weiß, was man da alles so konfiguriert hat. Man müsste sich das ja auch noch für die anderen 3 Voreinstellungen merken.
Meine Variante ist die: ich habe eine Kamera, wo ich mein Bild vorher sehe. ich konfiguriere mir meine X-S10 und die Knöpfe und Räder so, dass ich alles erreiche ohne in das Menü zu müssen und bin so schneller. Außerdem kann ich so für aktuelle Aufnahmesituation immer die passenden Parameter wählen.
Für spezielle Aufgaben wie Infrarot oder Sterne macht es dagegen vielleicht Sinn.

Lässt sich die X-S10 besser bedienen als die X-T4?

Für mich nicht, aber man kann sich damit arrangieren. bei der T4 habe ich alle fotorelevanten Einstellungen direkt an der Kamera, dazu sind die Räder auch beschriftet, der AF kann mittels Hebel unten verändert werden usw.
Für mich ist das die klassische Bedienung, weshalb ich mir Fujis zugelegt habe.
Trotzdem kann man sich viele Dinge auch an der S10 dahin legen, wo man sie braucht und nach ein bisschen Zeit, weiß man wo die liegen und kann die Kamera auch reibungslos bedienen.

Ist der IBIS sinnvoll?

Ja er ist in meinen Augen mehr als sinnvoll, weil er alle angesetzten Objektive stabilisiert, egal ob sie einen OIS haben oder nicht. Außerdem sorgt er für ein ruhiges Sucherbild bei langen Brennweiten und für ruhige Freihand -Videos. Ich finde es gar nicht so relevant, ob ich jetzt ein Bild 2s belichten kann, ohne zu verwackeln, aber gerade in den Grenzbereichen so um 1/30s macht man eine Vielzahl an schärferen Bilder, als wenn man keinen hätte. Mit dieser zeit gehen auch noch Portraits bei wenig Licht usw.

Ist die X-S10 gut verarbeitet?

Ja, sehr gut, obwohl sie kompakt und leicht ist. Trotzdem lässt sie sich auch gern in größere Hände nehmen, fasst sich wertig an und macht wie alle Fujis einen soliden Eindruck.

Gibt es etwas zu bemängeln?

Ja, eine spärliche deutsche Anleitung und das fehlende Ladegerät. Nachdem bei der T4 ja wenigstens noch ein Stecker dabei ist, ist es jetzt nur noch ein Kabel. Gut ist, dass es relativ preiswerte Ladegeräte gibt, die man hier kaufen kann.

Fazit: die X-s10 ist eine sehr gute Kamera, mit man alle fotografischen Aufgaben perfekt lösen kann. In Allianz mit perfekten Fuji Objektiven, die fast alle auf höchstem Niveau sind, macht das sehr viel Freude. Die Kamera lässt eigentlich nichts vermissen, ist schnell, kompakt, hat eine außerordentliche Bildqualität und stellt auch bei wenig Licht zuverlässig scharf. Man muss sich mit ihr beschäftigen, um ihre Fähigkeiten auszureizen, aber das ist bei anderen Kameras genauso. Mir als Fuji Fan gefällt zwar das Konzept nicht sonderlich gut, aber das muss jeder für sich entscheiden. Wenn Geld und ein bisschen mehr Gewicht keine Rolle spielt, dann würde ich mir die X-T4 auf alle Fälle mal ansehen. Für meine Verhältnisse ist das die beste Fuji Kamera.
Eine Empfehlung ist die X-S10 auf alle Fälle und auch eine der besten Kameras auf dem Markt in diesem Sektor und zu diesem Preis."

Eine weitere Spec-Schlacht ergibt da einfach keinen Sinn und würde keine echte Einschätzung zulassen, wie sich die Kamera im Alltag tatsächlich schlägt. Daher die aus meiner Sicht wichtigsten Punkte, die man über die X-S10 wissen sollte.

Handhabung:
Die Kamera ist angenehm kompakt, erst recht mit diesem Objektiv (XF 18-55mm 2.8-4.0 R LM OIS). Sie liegt durch ihren tiefen Handgriff sehr gut in der Hand. Man kann die Kamera mit dem Griff auch locker längere Zeit in der Hand halten, wenn man sie nicht mit dem Tragegurt trägt. Mit vergleichbaren Kameras anderer Hersteller taten mir so irgendwann die Finger weh.

Apropos Gurt: der ist angenehm schmal und sehr dezent. Nur ein kleiner weißer Schriftzug weißt im unteren (!) Teil des Gurtes auf die Marke hin. Also keine übertriebene Zurschaustellung der Marke. Top!

Bildqualität:
Ein erheblicher Mehrwert der X-S10 ggü. den Konkurrenten ist die Qualität der JPEGs. Die Kamera bietet die Möglichkeit, mit Filmsimulationen (im Prinzip sind das Farbprofile) sehr brauchbare JPEGs direkt aus der Kamera zu generieren. Natürlich muss man ein wenig Ausprobieren und Testen. Jeder Anwender einer Systemkamera steht aber nunmal vor der Frage: JPEG oder RAW? Ja, es geht auch beides, aber darum geht’s hier nicht. RAWs brauchen zu 99% Nacharbeit und sind zudem sehr groß. Die Nacharbeit kostet vor allem Zeit und Geld (z.B. für Lightroom). Hat man hingegen ein Gefühl für die JPEG-Möglichkeiten der Fuji bekommen, kann man einfach und schnell die Bilder nutzen und genießen (ohne, dass sie wochenlang auf Bearbeitung warten). Wer es besonders eilig hat kann schon auf dem Heimweg die Bilder per App aufs Smartphone übertragen und sofort bei Instagram posten. ;-) Übrigens bieten fast alle anderen Fujifilm-Kameras ebenfalls die Filmsimulationen und damit auch brauchbare JPEGs.

Unterstützt wird das Ganze durch einen wirklich sehr guten und rauscharmen Sensor, der zusätzlich auch noch stabilisiert ist (IBIS). Nur wenige Kameras bieten in diesem Preissegment eine vergleichbare Funktion. Verwendet man zusätzlich noch eines der stabilisierten OIS-Objektive von Fuji, kann man richtig gute Aufnahmen in dunklen Umgebungen aus der Hand (!) machen. Echt stark!

Bedienung:
Die X-S10 ist nicht die einfachste Kamera, keine Frage. Aber sie erschlägt den Nutzer auch nicht mit einer endlosen Liste an Funktionen. Die Bedienung erfordert etwas Einarbeitung. Hat man seine Konfiguration vorgenommen, geht das Fotografieren aber leicht und schnell von der Hand. Helfen tut dabei auch der praktische Blendenring an den Fuji-XF-Objektiven.

Objektiv:
Das Objektiv XF 18-55mm 2.8-4.0 R LM OIS ist eine sehr gute Allround-Ergänzung. Es ist optisch stabilisiert und besticht vor allem durch seine Größe und Verarbeitung. Im Prinzip ist es ein besseres Zoom-Objektiv ggü. der XC-Serie und sollte gewöhnlichen Ansprüchen mehr als genügen. Die Kamera passt damit sogar in eine größere Jackentasche. ;-) Für optische Besonderheiten (z.B. höhere Lichtstärke oder Sonnensterne) sollte man auf das etwas größere, aber auch teurere XF16-80mmF4 R OIS WR zurückgreifen, das es ebenfalls im Kit mit der X-S10 gibt.

Ein wesentlicher Kaufgrund für die X-S10 waren tatsächlich die Objektive, im Speziellen die von Fujifilm selbst. Im Verhältnis zu Canon oder Nikon gibt es auf dem Markt zwar deutlich weniger Fuji-Objektive von Drittanbietern (wie z.B. von Tamron), weniger ist hier allerdings nicht schlechter. Die Objektive von Fuji sind sehr gut, vor allem die XF-Serie. Für jeden Einsatzzweck gibt es mindestens ein Objektiv im mittleren Preissegment.

Fazit:
Die Kamera ist perfekt für Familien und Leute, die mit Systemkameras auf Tuchfühlung gehen wollen. Technisch lässt die X-S10 kaum Wünsche offen und bietet wirklich viel fürs Geld. Sie ist kompakt, wertig, durchdacht und bereitet (nach etwas Einarbeitung) richtig Freude am Fotografieren. Die JPEG-Fähigkeiten erlauben den schnellen Genuss der Bilder.

Fujifilm bietet zudem hochwertige Objektive. In jedem Fall rate ich zu einem XF-Objektiv, mag der Preis im ersten Moment auch hoch sein - es lohnt sich. Sehr empfehlenswert!"

I prerequisiti erano:
- Obiettivi intercambiabili
- Dimensioni contenute
- stabilizzatore (vi diranno che non serve, che è una cavolata, che ci vuole la mano, che bisogna impostare n-mila settaggi e che se le foto vengono mosse è solo colpa vostra, il che al 90% è vero) averlo è una goduria, anche se pochi gli stop che si guadagno almeno per me sono veramente comodi, e i video sono fantastici, avendo un obbiettivo anch'esso stabilizzato si riescono a fare davvero cose molto interessanti.
- display orientabile/estraibili, che a molti non piace perchè disallinea l'asse obiettivo con quello del mirino, ma a me piace tantissimo. E soprattutto può essere girato a 180° in modo da nascondere e proteggere l'lcd e dando al contempo un look retro che mi piace moltissimo.
- flash, avevo provato la X-E4, anch'essa ottima, ma il flash per quanto piccolo o riduttivo sia, credo sia un qualcosa che non deve mancare.

E la X-S10 ha tutte queste caratteristiche. Ero un po' preoccupato dall'ingombro dell'impugnatura, che mi sembrava troppo pronunciata ma credetemi ora la considero un assoluto punto di forza. Poter impugnare la macchina solo da lì è fantastico.

Detto questo le foto sono come per la altre fuji di fascia X belle e pulite, i filtri delle fuji per le jpg inutile dirlo danno subito risalto alle foto. I 26mp forse un pelino pochi, ma quello che fa la differenza alla fine è la lente che ci montate e l'occhio che avete che anche un non professionista come me può ottenere degli scatti assolutamente soddisfacenti.

Difetti, se così vogliamo chiamarli, possono essere la messa a fuoco che a volte presenta un po' di titubanze, ma risolvibili con qualche correzione, e la connessione al pc, soprattutto in modalità wifi che necessita di un po' di lavoro extra.

Ci sarebbe altro da dire e magari aggiornerò la recensione, per ora la trovo ottima, bella da usare e con una sensazione molto piacevole nel tenerla in mano. Super consigliata."

Chan,The best camera body under £1000,2021-08-30,"I bought this as an upgrade to my X-T30. Initially I was put off by the different controls from the traditional Fuji cameras, but having used it a few weeks now I actually find it easier to setup the camera to exactly how I want it. I mainly shoot in aperture priority and set up the C4 custom dial as my main profile as this is next to the video on the PASM dial, one click of the dial is a lot more convenient than turning half way round the dial.

In terms of image quality it is pretty much identical to the X-T30, that is, it’s excellent and has the same Fuji colours. The X-S10 does have one extra film simulation mode, Eterna bleach bypass, not something I’ve used, but I guess its still one more than the X-T30. What is useful over the X-T30 is that the film simulation menu now gives you more details about the film simulation and its intended use. These film simulations can also be applied to video which it can record in 4k/dci up to 30fps and 10x slow motion at 240fps in 1080p. Where the X-T30 had a record limit of only 10 minutes in 4k video, the X-S10 can record the industry standard 30 minutes of 4k.

Build quality is solid and feels better built than the X-T30 which was already pretty good. The handling is also so much better with the larger grip, something which the X-T30 was lacking even when fitted with a grip/L bracket. The X-S10 feels so much better in the hand and makes for easier one handed operation even with a heavier/larger lens. The touchscreen is the same size as the X-T30 but as it is also a flips out it makes it more versatile especially for low angle shots or for selfie/vlogging.

If vlogging or video shooting is what you do a lot the the 5-axis in body image stabilisation when paired with a lens with optical image stabilisation makes for a very smooth stabilised video. This can be further enhanced with the digital stabilisation function in camera though it will slightly crop the image when doing so. All the prime lenses for Fuji X mount do not have any form of stabilisation so the inclusion of I.B.I.S is a massive benefit if you shoot with prime lenses. It will allow you to shoot handheld video and longer shutter duration photos in low light situations.

To sum up the main benefits this camera has over the X-T30, they are the image stabilisation, the grip, the custom dial and the flip screen. It has everything all that you ever need for a hybrid shooter. But if there is one thing I do miss, it is the dial you get on the X-T30 that is sadly missing on the X-S10, the focus mode dial….."

Siempre le encontraremos algún ""pero"" y seguramente la compararemos con nuestra cámara anterior. En mi caso vengo de una Samsung NX-500 que toma muy buenas fotos pero dejó de ser compatible a partir del iPhone XS y no pude conectarla más remotamente. Me ha costado bastante tiempo descubrir cuál era la cámara equivalente para reemplazarla. Me parece haber acertado con la Fujifilm X-S10, pues toma excelentes fotos. Estuve dudando en comprarla con el objetivo de 16-80 pero finalmente analicé para que la quería y primó más la ligereza y el poder llevarla cómodamente en el cuello sin que moleste (18-55 finalmente).
He añadido dos fotos de paisajes tomadas con esta cámara y los detalles y colores son increíbles. Es cierto que no en todas las situaciones se obtienen fotografías así y probablemente en algún momento se necesitará ajustar el contraste (bajarlo) con algún programa de edición.
La conexión con el móvil a través del programa Cam Remote es interesante pero me parece que necesita cierto desarrollo, ya que, en algunos casos, cuando quiero tomar fotos utilizando el móvil, la imagen se congela y tarda en conectarse. No me extraña porque he tenido otras cámaras que les pasaba algo similar. Espero que con alguna actualización mejoren este punto, que fue precisamente el que me motivó a cambiar de cámara.
Finalmente mi petición es para Amazon, para que controle a los falsos vendedores que pululan por aquí. En más de una ocasión he comprado productos y luego me han anulado la venta. Eso genera mucha frustración pues uno cree haber encontrado el producto deseado a un precio increíble y no es así."

Nachdem ich jahrelang SLRs von Nikon besaß, bin ich nun zu Fujifilm gewechselt, da ich deren Angebote für um die 1000 Euro am attraktivsten fand.

Was zuerst auffällt. auch gegenüber meinen früheren Nikons, ist die wertige Verarbeitung. Alles fühlt sich solide, langlebig, und nicht nach Plastikspielzeug an. Trotzdem ich große Hände haben lässt sich die Kamera dank des großen Griffes gut halten und bedienen. Dank des gegenüber anderen Fuji-Kameras geänderten Bedien-Konzeptes fällt die Umgewöhnung nicht schwer.

Gleichzeitig ist das Bedienkonzept mein Hauptkritikpunkt: es gibt eine riesige Auswahl an Einstellmöglichkeiten, sowohl im Menü an sich, als auch in der Belegung der Buttons/Tasten. Und da ist die UX einfach nicht gut. Zum einen hätte man das Menü in einen Einfach/Erweitert-Bereich splitten, zum anderen hätte man mehr Hilfen bei den oft kryptischen Bezeichnungen anbieten können. Auch das Quickmenü sollte nicht nur auf Icons basieren, sondern zusätzlich Labels aufweisen. Das wäre innerhalb des Menüs sicher darstellbar.
Sicher, man kann sich einarbeiten, aber es ginge besser.

Das trübt den Gesamteindruck aber nur minimal, denn hat man sich dort durchgequält - oder nimmt einfach die Auto-Einstellung - wird man mit brillianten Bildern belohnt, die aus der Kamera heraus hervorragend sind, und den Nachbearbeitungs-Aufwand erheblich reduzieren. Hier ist das Ergebnis erheblich besser als bei meiner vorherigen Nikon. Auch das Kit-Objektiv ist weit besser als das, was ich bisher gewohnt war.

Alles in allem eine sehr empfehlenswerte Kamera."

Il est très réactif et la prise en main est vraiment excellente (meilleure que sur certains full frame haut de gamme).

L'écran LCD complètement articulé et tactile est un bonheur à utiliser pour la photo de rue et contrairement à certains autres avis, le viseur électronique n'est pas du tout trop petit(même si l'on porte des lunettes).

Oui mais voilà, il comporte pour moi un défaut ""objectif"" et un défaut ""subjectif"".
Objectivement, la batterie se vide beaucoup trop vite. Le boîtier est parfait pour la photo de rue en terme de poids et d'ergonomie MAIS une après-midi de street photographie vous demandera d'emporter plusieurs batteries car leur autonomie est vraiment faiblarde (surtout en comparaison du récent XT-4 ou des hybrides Sony), ce qui est vraiment regrettable.

Enfin, et c'est la raison pour laquelle j'ai renvoyé ce boîtier à amazon, il faut être familier du ""rendu fujifilm"" qui donne un aspect ""argentique""/bruité/rugueux aux photos que l'on prend, photos qui me semblent manquer de netteté, clarté et d'éclat par rapport à ce qu'on obtient chez Nikon.

This has the latest of everything, with in body image stabilisation, the version 4 sensor and processing and the same lens options.

So, you get fantastic photos and Fujifilm’s amazing film simulation options for beautiful photo tone and colours without needing to learn editing software. All this is also true of other new models.

What sets the X-S10 apart is how easy it makes everything. It has a layout and control scheme the is more similar to other brands, taking a step away from the retro inspired manual controls of others in the range.

So, if having manual control of everything is something you don’t really want to worry about, but you still want the Fujifilm style and quality. This is the one to get.

I’ve had mine a month or more now, shooting about 3,000 images. All I can say is ‘wow’! What this camera can do is just ridiculous. The quality is incredible and the stabilisation allows hand held shots way after sunset. It’s nuts what you can get away with. So happy to have it."

Ich kann beim besten Willen nicht verstehen, warum jemand ein Produkt mit 1 Stern bewertet, nur auf Grundlage einer fehlenden BDA?
Zumal auch die Aussage mzum Fujifilm Support nicht stimmt. Ich habe den Support per E-Mail angeschrieben und habe innerhabl von einer halben Stunde eine Rückmeldung samt deutscher Bedienungsanleitung als PDF Datei bekommen!
Auch kann man inzwischen auf der Homepage die BDA (auch in deutsch) kostenlos herunterladen. Somit sind seine Aussagen in seiner Rezension nicht wahr!

Zur Kamera und dem Objektiv. Alles in allem sehr erstklassig verarbeitet und macht sofort einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck. Das Objektiv ist aus Metall und liegt sehr schön in der Hand. In Kombi mit der Kamera ist die Haptik sehr ausgewogen.

Bei der Kamera fällt sofort der Griff auf und es macht Spass die Kamera zu halten. Kein Vergleich zu anderen Kameras in ihrer Größe. Ich komme von Canon und die X-S10 entspricht in etwa der Canon EOS M5. Da kann sich Canon noch ein paar Scheiben abschneiden, was Materialien, Ausstattung und Preis-Leistungsverhältnis angeht.
Den Wechsel habe ich nicht bereut und es macht einfach Spass mit der Kamera zu arbeiten.

Auch der Retro-Look, für den Fujifilm bekannt ist, trifft genau meinen Geschmack. Die Bedienung ist sehr einfach, wenn man sich mit der Kamera vertraut gemacht hat. Das schöne bei Fuji ist, man kann alle Tasten und Bedienelemte nach seinen eigenen Wünschen konfigurieren. Das geht bei Canon nur sehr bedingt und auch hier hat Fuji deutlich die Nase vorn, was das Handling und den Workflow angeht.

Das schöne an der X-S10 ist, dass Fuji hier eine Brücke für Wechsler schlägt, durch sein geändertetes Bedienkozept. Mit dieser Kamera kommen Neueinsteiger von anderen Herstellern wie Sony, Canon oder Nikon sehr leicht zurecht.

Ich kann nur sagen, dass Fujifilm mit der X-S10 eine hochwertige Kamera an den Start gebracht hat, welche mit vielen Ausstattungsmerkmalen einer Highend-Kamera versehen ist und das zu einem Preis von knapp unter 1.000 Euro für den Body. Da kann man bei anderen Herstellern lange suchen, das gibt es einfach nicht."

Nun, im Gegensatz zur Vollformat ist sie wirklich sehr handlich und ich bekomme alle meine Objektive in eine kleine Fototasche. Ich kann die Kamera also überall mitnehmen, wo ich sonst meine Canons zuhause liegen lassen würde.
Zu Beginn war ich noch unschlüssig, ob ich die Kamera behalten sollte. Die ersten Ergebnisse mit dem (wirklich guten) Kitobjektiv waren ernüchternd und hatten mich nicht überzeugt. Mein Hauptbereich ist die Portraitfotografie und da bin ich es gewohnt sehr offenblendig zu fotografieren. Und das geht mit so einem Kitobjektiv eben nicht.
Allerdings hatte ich mir die Kamera ja für andere Einsatzzwecke zugelegt und da hat sie mich wirklich überzeugt. Für Landschaftsaufnahmen oder Architektur ist das Kitobjektiv wirklich fantastisch. Eine sehr hochwertige Optik im Gegensatz zu den Kitobjektiven, die man üblicherweise so bekommt.
Ich habe mir mittlerweile noch weitere Objektive zugelegt und mit einem 35mm f/0,95 bekomme ich sogar den Look hin, den ich bei Vollformat gewohnt bin.
Die Bedienung der Kamera ist sehr intuitiv und es fiel mir leicht auch ohne Bedienungsanleitung loszulegen."

Genau gegen XT3 abwägen!,2020-12-03,"Diese Kamera geht einen anderen Weg als andere Modelle von Fuji. Das ist mutig, da Fuji Fanboys das klassische Bedienkonzept vermissen werden und man damit rechnen kann, dass die Kamera deswegen bei einigen als mega uncool gelten wird. Die XT3 z.B. wird immer ästhetisch vorne sein und ist jetzt schon ein modern classic. Die X-S10 ist dagegen just another camera und wird irgendwann vergessen sein. Obwohl sie technisch ja absolut ebenbürtig ist.

Besondere Vorsicht ist jetzt geboten in der Auswahl, weil die XT3 derzeit Ende 2020 mit Fuji Cash Back genauso teuer ist, aber eigentlich hochwertiger gebaut ist (Die XT3 ist wetterfest und hat den besseren Sucher!!). Nun - dafür hat die X-S10 IBIS, ist kleiner und hat diesen genialen Griff. Aber da die Fuji Coolness ein wenig wegfällt, muss man natürlich schon überlegen, ob die viel günstigere Nikon Z50 nicht die bessere Wahl ist. Die hat nämlich auch einen richtigen Griff - im Gegensatz zu den anderen Fujis.

Also: Tolle Kamera, aber man muss sich gut überlegen, ob man das wirklich so will... Ich denke mit der XT3 wäre ich zufriedener, aber die XS10 ist so eine schöne kleine point and shoot Kamera und man möchte einfach nur in full Auto damit Bilder machen. Trotzdem : Ich denke der Hype vor release war nicht gerechtfertigt. Ob IBIS das killer feature ist... ich denke nicht.

Update: Nach einigen Tagen mit der Kamera bleibe ich dabei: Es geht um schnelle, unkomplizierte und herausragende Fotos mit zeitgemäßem Video. Manuelle Sachen gehen zwar alle, gehen aber nicht so flott von der Hand. Für manuelle Ambitionen und das klassische Kameragefühl hat Fuji andere tolle Kameras. Letztlich für mich der Griff der ausschlaggebende Punkt und die wunderschönen Bilder, die man mit einer Einfachheit macht, die man gar nicht mehr missen will."

Los colores son geniales y no tiene nada de colores falsos incluso a ISO 12800.
Como pasa con todas las cámaras digitales, la configuración por defecto no aprovecha todas sus posibilidades. En mi opinión hay que activar el DR-P (arregla muy bien los contraluces y no tiene efectos negativos en otros casos) y poner la reducción de ruido al mínimo (hay más ""granos"" de ruido pero son más finos y se mantienen mucho mejor los detalles).

El 18-55 es muy rápido enfocando y al grabar video con el micro de la cámara no se oye para nada. Otra ventaja es que no cambia de focal al enfocar.

A diferencia de otras Fuji, los controles de la cámara son ""modernos"" (parecidos al resto de marcas) y a mí me parecen bastante más cómodos y configurables (5 botones y una rueda) que los ""clásicos"". Otra ventaja es la empuñadura que permite usar la cámara con una mano (la derecha)."

La costruzione e' ottima, si sente subito la solidita' del corpo macchina e della lente ( nel mio caso il 18-55 XF) .
I menu' sono sembrati un po' complessi a primo impatto, ma dopo qualche giorno iniziano ad avere senso.

La qualita' delle immaggini e' ottima anche in JPEG, grazie alle simulazioni pellicola e ad una vasta gamma di settaggi disponibili.

Il mio utilizzo principale e' il video, e devo dire che se la cava egregiamente. La stabilizzazione del sensore aiuta molto, anche con l'utilizzo di lenti senza OIS.
Il grip piu' grande rispetto alle altre fuji permette di effettuare riprese a mano con piu' sicurezza.

La mancanza dello slot UHS-II e della registrazione 10-bit interna potrebbe far storcere il naso ai professionisti, ma per uso amatoriale o semi-pro credo sia una ottima macchina. Inoltre questi problemi sono risolvibili con un registratore esterno."

Pero yo realizo la mayoría de mis fotos empleando el visor, y éste además de ser de una resolución menor que el de otros modelos (Fuji X-T3, Nikon Z50...) es demasiado pequeño y está demasiado pegado a la cámara. Al ser pequeño has de pegarte mucho a la cámara para ver los bordes del encuadre y como tiene muy poca separación con el cuerpo pues te ves obligado a presionar mucho la nariz resultando muy molesto.

Aclarar que con otras cámaras que he probado no me había ocurrido este inconveniente."

Meine bisherigen Erfahrungen sind enttäuschend: Fuji hat seit der Markteinführung im Nov. 2020 vier Firmwareupdates spendiert. Sicher erforderlich?! Der Autofocus sitzt beim Filmen jedoch trotzdem nicht! Mit dem XF 18-135mm habe ich die Erfahrung gemacht, dass es sich gar nicht zum Filmen eignet, da der AF pumpt! Heute dann die herbe Enttäuschung mit dem XC 50-230mm: ein Insekt, welches fliegt, schafft der AF einfach nicht. Im Menü habe ich alles richtig eingestellt, so kompliziert ist das nicht. Dazu muss ich am PC in der Bedienungsanleitung nachlesen, denn die gibt es nur als PDF in deutscher Sprache und nicht in Papierform. Auch ein Ladegerät hätte ich mir gewünscht, dies gibt es ebenfalls nicht dazu. Knappe 1000,- Euro für den Body, Reserveakku, Ladegerät extra kommt man schnell über 1000,- Euro. Sehr, sehr schade, Fuji!
Update vom 24.05.2021
Meine Erfahrungen mit dem XF 10-24mm sind ebenfalls negativ: obwohl zunächst eine Schärfe nach dem Videoaufnahmestart kurzzeitig erfolgt, pumpt der Autofocus mehrmalig während der restlichen Aufnahmezeit. Es erfolgten dazu ausnahmslos Landschaftsaufnahmen. Alle drei bisher genannten Originalobjektive von Fuji besitzen den neuesten Stand der Firmware und immer wurde mit einem Stativ gearbeitet!"

I thought the R6 would be just another tool, but as it turns out it's so much more. The camera is a joy to use. Starting off with the auto focus since that is a major improvement over previous Canon models. I've used the auto eye tracking on the 90D the R and RP and it was mediocre, working only when you were close to your subject. The R6 is, for lack of a better term, game changing. It can find and track the eyes of people and animals at far distances and is always spot on. It really takes time to learn and just let the camera do it's job, because I could never trust a camera to just find my subject and nail the focus. The images are sharp and RAW colors straight out of the camera are beautiful. The R6 uses the same 20mp sensor as the 1DX MarkIII which costs four thousand dollars more. In case anyone is wondering, yes 20mp is more than enough and the images out of the R6 are crisp and detailed. You basically have the guts of a 6500.00 camera in the body of a 2400 camera. The smaller file size also doesn't slow down my workflow. The low light high ISO performance is like no other camera I have used. I can shoot at up to ISO 25,600 and get perfectly usable images. I rarely shoot at these settings, but it's nice to know I can. The IBIS is something I didn't would think that mattered much to me until I bought the RF800 f/11. I would usually shoot at 1/800 minimum shutter speed, but the one's above were both shot at 1/400 handheld with no camera shake. The battery life is ok and I get around 500 shots per charge. Before I bought the R6, I owned three other Canon full frame cameras plus the 80D, and 90D. I shortly sold them all keeping only an R and 6D for backup because they were no longer being used. This camera has brought back the fun I used to have taking photos in my younger days."

A Very capable. Very Good Camera,2022-11-19,"Been using this camera for months and so far, I'm very impressed. Low light capabilities are great. I've done pictures at parties and a wedding and the lighting was very dim. I had flash, but did not overdo the brightness of the flash as to keep the mood and lighting of the venue intact. The grain at 6400 to 10,000 ISO can be seen, but it's nothing that some noise and color noise reduction can't fix. Sharpness remains intact.

Photo quality, auto focus and stabilization from the IBIS do well. No complaints. I started with the Canon M50, moved on to the Canon R and while shooting with the R and R6, both do well, but the IBIS and improved auto focus do make a difference. The Canon R may have more megapixels, but there seems to be an extra bit of sharpness with the R6. If cropping, there can be some limitations with less pixels, but with that, it will require using the right tools even better and having the right focal length for what you are shooting.

Video options may be lacking in some areas comparted to a cheaper camera like the Canon R, but I still like the quality of video better, especially due to the better quality image with a high ISO.

Overall, this is a great camera. After later firmware updates when I purchased, with how I shoot and do video, no issues, even with 4K video."

I already had a mirrorless, an older Sony Nex 5N that I loved, but it is aps-c and it’s hard to go back once you have full frame. So based on the silent electronic shutter, the fact that I can shoot only with the back screen and not have to hide behind a viewfinder, I can do 20 fps, I can use all my EF lenses with an adapter and it’s a smaller footprint, it’s THE perfect camera for me. I don’t care about shooting video with it because if you really want to do video you need a dedicated 4K camcorder which I have, so any issues with video on this camera don’t matter to me. The pictures are amazing at 12,800 and even 51,200 iso! Thank you Canon! I fear I may never touch my 5D MIII again!
PS only one tiny thing I have noticed: you need to turn ON the setting that forces the camera to focus even when focusing is impossible - sometimes in more dim lighting especially with the adapter, it acts dead and just doesn’t even try to focus. This is using the point spit focus mode. Not a big deal since you can fix it by turning this setting on."

I have nothing negative to say about this camera other than, once in a while the view finder gets a little jerky for a few seconds for some reason. I have not been able to determine the cause, but it isn't really annoying. Anyway...
I upgraded both of my original Rs to the R6 and I could not be happier. The eye autofocus is every bit as good as they say, it's fast, it's comfortable and the image quality is the best I have ever seen from any camera. Lots of people are hung up on the fact that it is only a 20MP sensor, but the color tones, sharpness and everything else about the images are absolutely jaw dropping straight out of the camera. I am reminded that it is the same sensor from the 1DX3 every time I shove a SD card into my computer. This has been saving me a ton of time editing photos. It almost feels like I'm cheating. I still edit, but not nearly to the level that I had to before. This is a big deal to me as I do photography full time for a living.
What else... the body is made form the exact same material that Canon uses for the RF lenses. If it's good enough for a $3000 lens, it's good enough for a $2500 body. I do wish the rear screen was a little bigger, but it works.
This is the camera I have been dreaming Canon would make and I am loving it. I am soooo glad they made this thing! I really didn't want to have to go to 45MP and pay for 8k that I will never use with the R5. I shoot stills, no video and for me, this is as perfect as it gets."

So worth the money. I have a few things to point out to those of you who are looking for some specs. 1 off, the high pulse shutter speed with the mechanical shutter will not work with a nockoff battery even at a full charge. It will do the 20 frames per second in electronic shutter, but not the high pulse 12 in mechanical. 2nd thing is, I have had nothing but great words for Amazon. I was out in the water with this camera in its water housing, when it leaked and fried my camera. I contacted Amazon because it was still under warranty. I wasn’t sure if they would accept this du to the water and not an actual device malfunction. Without hesitation they replaced my product and I am receiving it it a few days. I could not be happier!! Customer support was EXCELLENT!!

This camera is as good as everybody said. The low light is AMAZING and the (low) 20.1 megapixels creates stunningly sharp images even with the cheaper RF 50mm f1.8.

Ps this photo was taken using the canon r6 + canon RF 800mm. This was shot in a lower Leigh hat situation. STUNNING."

I shoot a lot of low light indoor events such as plays, musicals and dances. I was concerned about the size of the sensor ""only"" being 20MP compared to the EOS R5 of 45MP but was swayed by the price difference as well as the better low light capability of the R6. After shooting numerous productions, I no longer have any qualms in purchasing this camera.

With the ""L"" series glass I have, I am getting very sharp, detailed, photos even when the subject was on stage and I was at the back of the auditorium. I don't enlarge my photos to wall or billboard sized prints but for what my photos are used for - advertisements, brochures, social media and poster sized prints, the camera performs flawlessly.

If I planned wall sized, highly detailed photos I would consider the EOS R5 but for what I need, the EOS R6 was a good choice and I have absolutely no regrets in buying it."

I started getting more gigs and needed a new body to be more capable of shooting weddings, families, etc. I stumbled upon the R6 and I have NEVER been so happy with a camera purchase! By no means is this a downgrade from the more expensive R5. It may have less features but this is still a professional and high quality camera at a more affordable price than the R5.

Not only are the picture capabilities superb, the 4K60fps video with Canon's C-log is also nothing to laugh at

If you're looking to invest in a full frame camera and have some money to spend, the R6 is the perfect choice."

I’m just an amateur that’s loves landscape and animal photography. This is my fifth canon camera since my first A-1 back in the early 1980s. With each camera I purchased I could say it was the best camera I have used. The R6 is no different. There’s much to learn on using it. However it’s a Canon so it’s easy and fun to learn new things. The picture quality is just amazing. I highly recommend the R6.

The Canon EOS R6 is overall a great camera to have for birds and animals and if you are into people portraits. I think so anyways.
I have not used the video recording yet so I can not comment on what the video quality is like. But if it is anything like the stills quality, then I am sure it will be great.
Final word. If you are coming from the DSLR to the mirrorless system and are looking for a great professional camera. This could be the one for you. As a new photographer, who is looking to eventually become professional, I can honestly say that I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase."

This is my 4th canon DLSR and the first one that broke. I’m highly disappointed. It’s been a paperweight for 6 months because I haven’t sent it in yet.

I had Canon Rebel T2i with a few cheap EF and EF-S lenses which served me 10 years. The R6 is a fantastic upgrade which will last me another 10 years. It works awesome with EF 50mm + RF adapter just fine, producing images with great color and clarity. I can't wait to get the RF 24-100 or RF 24-70 later this year, so I can improve auto-focus even further.

Primary use case: taking pictures of kids and adults moving indoors and outdoors in low or challenging light. Our kids run around, people move freely, with this camera there's no need to bark at everyone forcing them to stop and pose. Phone cameras have become very good, but when it comes to printing photos or viewing them on a good monitor, my Pixel 4 is no match to a full frame high-end camera sensor and lens.

Highlight: F-value mode, where I can specify more than one priority manually, and let the camera figure the rest. I usually fix Time + Aperture pair."

I am using the 35mm 1.8 and it has been great for most shots. I eventually want to get wide aperture L glass, but that will come in time.

I also have not had a single issue with overheating at all. The reports are so blown out of proportion. I don't do a lot of photography, but I do wish it had a bit more megapixels (but that would probably affect how good it is in lowlight). It being a 21.4 megapixel sensor has not been a hindrance though. The picture quality is still great, you just aren't going to get a gigantic picture.

All in all I think this is one of the best cameras at this price, if you mainly do video and some photography."

The shadow recovery on this camera is insane... I've never had so much DR to adjust in post.

The 20mp is really not an issue at all, especially now with Adobe super enhance that 4x the image size without quality loss... This is literally a non issue. Even without super enhance, this camera is more than capable to print large prints.

Becasue the low MP, dark exposure and recovery is very clean.

Ergonomics of it feels great to me, and I've never really fully used a mirrorless camera before and didn't know what the hype was about until I got my hands on this one. For pixel peepers, they may not like the 20mp sensor but the smoothness and quality out of the portraits I got was amazing. Even better in my opinion than my work's 5D mk4. The eye auto focus is so magical and makes portrait photography that much more freeing to create. Camera features and handling - 10/10.

I do record videos, but never in 4k, because of the added upgrades to new computer hardware I'd have to get, so 1080 works great for me. It is also a plus that it has c-log that the 5D at work didn't (Opted out of c-log when we purchased it not knowing if we would need to, that was a mistake). So having c-log is awesome to experiment with.

This is the perfect camera for me - Light, ergonomic, portrait photographer power house that can dabble in video and learn.

THE BIGGEST and SCARIEST THING - Not just the overheating that I've seen so many reviews on. Not that. I don't record 4k as stated above, BUT after only 2 weeks of use (photography and 1080 video) the touch screen went completely blank and never turned back on. Never dropped, never handled roughly, never taken and introduced to extreme weather or dust. Yes I checked if something was blocking the viewfinder sensor, yes I checked to see if I had somehow turned off the screen in the settings tabs some how, but no. It went out within only 2 weeks of having this in my hands. I've read about 2 more reviews on B and H and here that had had similar issues. I've put in to return the camera and am waiting for my refund.

I am giving this camera and Canon one more chance and purchasing a second one as soon as my refund comes back. I always saw canon cameras as work horses and power houses so this R6 crapping out in just 2 weeks is very very disappointing. I don't know why of all things the screen to fail first.. and within 2 weeks... They've had screens on the backs of cameras for forever and yet this one fails. I hope that my next one is not a dud."

As mirrorless became more and more available, I figured it was a good time to reevaluate since most systems have new lens mounts anyway. I'm glad I tried the Canon. It's everything I've wanted in an event camera system. Not too many megapixels which presents a file size problem when shooting all day weddings and mitzvahs.

I wish it was higher resolution like the R5, but realistically I don't do large prints of my photos often and if you don't either just go with this over the R5. Love the camera!"

I only press the movie record button when someone is on a wave. So most of the time I am just aiming the camera at the surfer waiting to press the record button for a 20 second ride. I come home with approximately 15, 20 second clips after each session. Just waiting with the camera on makes it over heat! Without even recording the 20 second movies. The reason I shoot 4k 60 is so I can take frame grabs essentially getting 60 photos per second. The quality is amazing, but there is no way for me to use the camera. I just sit there and watch the record time dropping till it is in overheat mode untill I have to shut it off. Totally unacceptable. I shoot in the morning at 6:30 am so it is not hot out ether. There is no way to turn off the camera between shots because you need to stay focused on the surfer in case a wave starts breaking. I tried turning it off, but by the time it fires back up and regains focus at 600mm, it is too late. The quality of the shots is amazing, but there is no way to use the camera for extended periods of waiting between shooting a 20 second movie. I really cant beleive it overheats just waiting. I even did the firmware update and still the same issue. GUess I will not be selling my 7D MK II after all just in case."

The specs between he R5 and R6 were close enough to steer me towards the cheaper one. Coming from the 1DX, I ended up being disappointed in the R6. It was nice in daylight, but the second the sun went down, the focus would get thrown way off at times and struggle to refocus (using center point and Serve mode). Disappointing when you expect the latest, greatest focusing system, to say the least.

Not saying its a bad camera, a lot of hobbyist, amateur photographers will love it, but I couldn't trust it to perform in high-stress situations while shooting the Daytona 500.

It's possible I got a bad copy of the camera. I went ahead and returned and went for the R5, which so far I'm much happier with."

- You have only 2 modes in video, full auto or full manual. You don't have semi auto mode like priority speed or priority aperture. (you can just set the iso to auto in manual mode).
- If you plug an external monitor, The display will only be on your external monitor. You won't have access to the camera monitor, that means you will not be able to do anything related to your touchscreen, like adjust your focus point directly on the screen.

For an expensive camera like this, I think it's really a shame, specially because the canon R have all this possibilities and it's way more cheaper."

I take perfect care of all of my gear. 6 months after purchasing this camera the hot shoe is now loose… okay, fairly common. Go to tighten the screws and find out you HAVE to tighten them from the inside. Okay again, maybe they made it easy. NOPE. You have to ship it in to get repaired which thankfully I am under warranty now but all they do is tighten them and when it comes loose again you send it back. No thread lock or anything. All newer models have this and it will be a huge issue.

I’m very sad because otherwise I love the canon mirrorless lineup - canon in general. But this seems like a very “Apple” thing to do. Looks like I’ll be holding onto my Sony A7iii’s and not ordering two R5’s until they fix this. My business can’t afford to send in my cameras every 6 months to have 4 screws tightened for HUNDREDS of dollars."

It’s just easy and perfect.

EXCEPT DO NOT EVER UPDATE FIRMWARE. I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN. I HAD A PRISTINE R6 THAT HAD ONLY BEEN USED A FEW TIMES AND I UPDATED FROM 1.4 TO 1.7 RESULTING IN INSTANT BANDING ISSUE SO I DID A SECOND UPDATE WHICH MADE BUTTONS TO SHOOT PICS AND VID AND AF INOPERABLE - AND CANON MADE ME PAY FOR IT ($400) WHEN IT WAS THEIR LOUSY FIRMWARE UPDATE THAT RUINED IT. Imagine if any product offering firmware updates (i.e. Adobe) made you pay when they ruined the product. Canon repair service could very well see there was nothing but a firmware problem - nothing mechanical and not a scratch on it and only 18 months old and the black box of it would show how little it was used in that time."

With the increased resolution, I especially like the performance with my 100-400 f4.5-5.6L IS II and my 70-200 f2.8L IS, as well as my other lenses, such as the 18-135 USM that I bought to use as a general walk-around lens. I use the fold-out, live viewing screen with smaller zooms, but also with my faster fixed lenses; which makes street photography much more versatile. I recall photographing the Cuna Indians in Panama in the late 60s. At that time they believed that the camera would steal their soul, so the would turn away or cover their faces. Sneaky me, I would set the mechanical timers on my Pentax Spotmatics, which were totally manual SLRs, and secretly shoot photos while the cameras with fast fixed lenses hung from my neck, while my hands were obviously nowhere near the camera. Click! Got it. Hah! So now I am adding the 90d's fold-out optical live view screen, in order hold the camera away from my face, and this photographer seems more innocuous. Of course there's more....such as video, which will eventually get around to using... More, also, since I still haven't had this little gem that long.

Looking back at the progress both of SLR and DSLR cameras; Film cameras, then earlier digitals, both full frame 5d series and the APSC 7d and 7d MKII. I am comparing some of my previous film cameras and their capabilities and versatility - and the resulting images - comparing with the Canon A2, and the A1, and the earlier Pentax Spotmatics I've had. Viewing comparatively, it's easy to see that the 90d is not a toy.

Yep, this 90d is is not full frame, but so what? Looking at the results vs the price, comparing those facets with previous film cameras and full size sensor digitals. The 90d is not overly expensive, and some people scoff at what they're calling non-professional. But in my case, with multiple decades of experience, it does produce professional results.
I have photo-gadget freak and pretentious wanna-be friends who've dumped multiple tens of thousands of $$ into their photography pass times, calling themselves professional this or that, bragging about top of the line this or that computer or photo equipment, much of which changes with the edition of each of the next new releases. Yet 98.5% of them have never made enough income with their ""art"" to even pay for a fraction of their photo and computer equipment.
Yeah, the proof is in the taste of the pudding.
As always, we need to see the finished products and those which is good enough to be hanging on any wall,
anywhere, and whether observers stop long enough to give it a good look, let alone even study it.
All of that, in defense of an inexpensive DSLR camera which does pretty well, and can & does yield ""professional,""
not merely trivialized ""enthusiast"" results.

Gripes would be:
1) That this 90d would be nice - for my own taste - if it were to be encased in a heavier, titanium alloy body, such as those that people refer to as more of a professional camera, like the 7d, versus an ""enthusiast"" camera, because of the weather proofing, etc. I would actually prefer a Mark III, in the 7d line, which I was waiting for, but apparently the 90d is IT; no more of the Canon 7d line. So I bought one and am satisfied with its performance.

2) The little whiz wheel in back, seems a bit small. But, that does also have a fast forward and back button in the middle of it.

3) And, whatever Gordon Laing has come up with; among all of the pros and cons of his thorough and snappy 90d review on YouTube."

It does everything as advertised. However, stay away from the kit lens Zoom 18-135mm. The picture quality is OK. Not the greatest, but the zoom ring on the lens I got is very stiff. If you plan to do a smooth zoom while shooting video, you will never get it. The lens is meant to be used with the Canon Power Zoom Adapter PZ-E1 which has been discontinued and is hard to find. The menu system is great. Autofocus is quick and quiet. The camera is very responsive even while using my older autofocus lens. Not sure how long Canon will continue marketing the 90D or any additional DSLRs, but this one is a winner."

Manual mode is really easy to use (I have past DSLR experience). The 90D is light, compact, and a lot of fun to take pictures with. Best quality pics I've been able to take.

I haven't tried the video mode for more than 10 minutes. Looks good, but definitely use a reliable tripod. Or some sort of gimble. The lense I used was an older one with no stabilization. I also didn't use all of the video settings im the menu. I'm still learning.

Overall, an expensive worthwhile purchase. The lense that comes in this kit is really really good too.

The kitty pic is the first picture I took with the Canon 90D."

Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Lens
SHURE LensHopper VP83 Microphone
Amazon Basics 50"" Tripod (Doesn't tip even at max height with the longer lens)
Gonine ACK-E6 AC Power Adapter (Great for stationary camera placement at long-running events)
BM 2-Pack of LP-E6N Batteries (Off-brand, but awesome reviews and 2600 mAh)

HOWEVER, sadly I found the camera package was not sealed, which was supposed to be so. What made me more disappointed is the main dial, which was stiff and but what made me even more dumbfounded is the camera lens, which might have been manufactured, hopefully not designed, for utilization of a wrench to make it turn. As every time I turned the lens manually (I was using the manual mode and had turned it to MF), I had an issue of turning it smoothly, in a soft fashion, the failure of which resulted in a shake of the camera. I've given the camera two stars for its delivery, but not the camera set. I'm definitely going to return it soon!

As we've bought Canon before, it works pretty well. I'm going to purchase another Canon 90D, and I wish the forthcoming new purchase would be without issues. Otherwise, I'm going to turn to other brands such as Sony and Olympus, both of which were purchased years ago and have been working amazingly well.

I'm going to leave my review for the new purchase after it's arrived and has been tested."

I did not receive the grip. Nor can I send an email, I have to call customer service...
The package came with one air pocket between the Canon package and the Amazon box...so there was cause for concern as to any damage.
Camera works, Lens is amazing. I want my grip...
Edit: 14 May 2020.
This “bundle” is no deal, and quite the misleading ad.
This does not come with the battery grip, even though it is shown for no reason. This bundle is also listed almost $600 higher than in the Canon USA site, and you get the exact same equipment.
This is obviously my own fault for not seeing that it wasn’t listed...nor do they have a product description informing of the full contents of this package.
I quite literally spent about $700 more than I needed, and will be returning this item as to purchase a bundle that comes with what is advertised."

It's user error, 100%, this camera works excellent in OBS with clean HDMI.

There's a really simple solution, read the manual.

1) yes, dummy batteries work, the rubber latch is also the door. Just lift it up instead of sliding it and the plug lines up, it's literally got a full image diagram on how to do this.

2) no, it doesn't charge by USB, it's a professional camera, not a webcam. Buy a few batteries if you need to use it away from a power source with the dummy battery. That's why they sell multiple battery slot chargers, that's what professional photographers do with professional cameras.

3) the software autosyncs to your computer and phone... If you read the manual, it tells you how step by step. In fact, you can choose between Bluetooth, wifi, or both.

Buy an SD card with a minimum 170mbps, Sandisk makes a bunch of them. I got the 170mbps 256gb, works great, and I can record over 4 hours of 4k footage to it.

I've literally never bought a professional camera before, so I did what any noob should, I read the manual and did research for about 2 weeks before choosing one and voila, now I know terminology, functions, settings, and can use the camera for streaming, photography, videos, OBS via HD60, etc...

If it's a bad review because of functions, it's very likely they didn't read the manual. Took me 3 hours to go through everything, and now I can operate the camera in a ton of different lighting conditions, environments, video use, streaming, whatever.

There's a term in tech, PEBKAM. It translates to 'Problem exists between keyboard and mouse'. Ultimately, it means the user is the problem, not the tech. I saw a bunch of 1 star reviews with a significant amount of upvotes, so these bad reviews are a problem. It's not the camera, the people who left the review didn't read how to use the camera. It's a shame, there's a lot of people that will overlook this beast of a camera just because someone that didn't read left a review. You read this, so kudos to you, you're better off than over 300 people that actually believed and found the 1 star reviews helpful.

This is an excellent camera for OBS if you use a capture card; I'm using the HD60 flawlessly, clean hdmi and all. While you can use USB, don't. It's just a feature they added for convenience, it's not going to be great quality on a USB connection.

Get a capture card if you want to use this as a webcam. It's a professional camera that has the added convenience of allowing a USB connection, not the other way around.

I highly recommend this camera; for the price point, you get a ton of features most other cameras don't have. If you are a camera noob like me, just read the manual, and use a search engine to look up terminology you don't understand. Within a few hours, you'll be able to use the camera to it's fullest extent; there's a learning curve, but also worth the time invested in studying. I'm getting excellent results, setting the correct ISO, using the proper lighting, etc.

If you are going for a blurry background with a focus on yourself, you might need a different lens. Don't get me wrong; this lens can do it a bit, probably enough for most people, but not okay if your subject is not very far away from the background to blur. If you don't know how to do this, search about aperture. Buy the camera with the default lens kit first, you'll likely buy the wrong thing if you don't understand the camera, lighting requirements, distance from camera/background. Read the manual, and look up all the terminology you don't understand first. Distance from background and lighting type makes a massive difference in which lens will be the correct to buy if you want an extremely blurry background with clear subject focus.

Is this camera for an amateur? No, not really. They did a great job explaining everything in their manual, and I got some additional help from YouTube, but here we are 24 hours after I opened the box, and now I'm pretty good at navigating it. I know what to look for in the settings for various lighting and distance scenarios because I read the manual."

Incluso si ya eres alguien intermedio o avanzado, esta cámara no te decepcionará en lo absoluto.

Un pequeño “pero” que encontré en muchos lados antes de comprarla, era la batería. Así que decidí comprar otras 2 de repuesto. Sin embargo, yo que uso más el Viewfinder en lugar de la pantalla LCD, la batería me dura considerablemente bien. Incluso un día entero de estar tomando fotos en algún evento. Adicionalmente a esto, si usas la pantalla LCD sugiero que actives el modo ECO y así la pantalla se apagará sola si no la estás usando.

Fuera de eso, la conectividad wifi/bluetooth con tu celular/iPad, las opciones de disparo, el video, y calidad de foto; son geniales."

I also worried a lot about the fact that I have absolutely zero background in photography other than the occasional photo taken with my iPhone.

The Canon EOS M50 Mark II was a camera that came recommended by many people online as a camera that is great for both photos and videos. I plan on using this to take pictures for social media as well as (maybe) a means for recording videos as well.

So far, I have been extremely happy with both the quality of the photos and the user-friendliness of the device. I've mostly been using the automatic setting, but I have played around a bit with the other modes as well, particularly for night photography. The process of taking photos and transferring them to your devices (be it mobile or computer) was simple, allowing me to do any editing as needed. There are also many features (including filters) available via the camera itself if you're unfamiliar with third-party editing software. The camera and lens are lightweight and a good size for portability. I had no problem carrying it with me when traveling."

It is fairly easy to use once you get the hang of the controls. The Cannon app allows the camera to send images directly to our IPhones, or shoot remotely so that is always a plus. The attached image was a simple point and shoot of the dog and the moon through my cheap telescope.

6 Month Update:
Absolutely no issues, we have snapped thousands of photos and are getting pretty good at photography now. It is still such a great buy, go ahead and buy if you are on the fence.

1 Year In:
Added a snap of the Geminids Meteor Shower on Orion’s Belt last night. A long way to go, but slowly becoming competent in Astrophotography with this camera. I would like to branch out with some new lenses this next year. We have been able to document our little boy’s first year of life with this camera, so the investment has been worth every penny.

1 1/2 Years:
Added the EF-M 22mm f2 lens to up my astrophotography game with this camera and the results are brilliant. It also works as a street prime as well. Camera is still functioning flawlessly. Added a shot of the Milky Way I took last night.

Purchased a Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens for beach photography and ended up shooting the Milky Way all night instead. Highly recommend that lens for the EF-M platform because it is pretty much a do-it-all lens.

2 Years In:
Still absolutely no issues. The Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens pretty much has found a permanent place on this camera after 6 months of shooting with it. Adding the best Milky Way photo I have to date using the Sigma captured at St. George Island, FL."

1. Just to be clear, the Mark II features completely clean HDMI with AF enabled. I used it yesterday.

2. You can get a special battery from Canon or any number of third-party suppliers that allows you to plug the camera into a standard wall socket so you never have to worry about batteries going dead.

3. Most non-camcorder-style consumer cameras include a 30-minute auto-shutoff ""feature"". They do this to avoid paying EU import taxes on video cameras (yeah, I know). Paying another $1,000 or even switching to another brand won't help you to avoid this particular cripple hammer. However, Canon engineers did have mercy on us and wrote the fix for this into the Canon EOS Utility software (free download from canon.com). Just connect the camera to any Windows or Mac computer (via USB) and run the utility. Note this is a completely different app from the Canon EOS Webcam Utility.

4. The Canon webcam utility is a joke. Just get a USB-HDMI dongle for $20 and use OBS or whatever to capture the video. You don't need the Elgato expensiveness unless you're actually serious about recording in 4K. The cheap ones will stream 1080P just fine.

Hope this has been helpful. Happy vlogging!"

The M50 mkII does an excellent job in almost all respects. Love the wireless connectivity and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the kit lens. I've attached a couple shots of my puppy as an example of how it performs.

The camera felt very small so I ended up getting a cage (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0865TTJC6/) which bulked up the grip and made the camera feel much more substantial. It is an essential accessory for this camera in my opinion. NOTE: I tried the SmallRig brand first but their version blocks access to the WiFi button on the side of the camera so I returned it. The cage I linked above doesn't have that issue.

Personal preference when it comes to the mirrorless technology and electronic viewfinder caused me to return the M50 mkII, but if that's not an issue for you I can highly recommend this camera. It produces excellent images and is very good value for money."

I'd recommend buying a bigger lens as the included lens doesn't have much zoom, but is great for vlogging, selfies or getting that awkward shot!

There are specific settings that are required by art festival juries, but the menu is difficult to understand, so I end up just using the hybrid auto selection. Pictures aren't bad in that mode, but not what I expected either. This Canon EOS M-50 is much like a digital SLR, except it's more compact. Bottom line, it's difficult to enter the settings required and there's redundancy at every turn, making this camera more suited for the professional and less for the amateur."

I returned that and decided to go with the m50 Mark ii since I read it had the newer features I liked about the m200 such as the eye detection and good focus. I am very happy with this camera because I now can use an external mic for quality audio (and not feel like I’d just gotten back from a run after a project-shouting into the cam haha). Also, the m200 could only do less than 10 minutes when on 4K before the battery heats up and camera shuts down. I do not have that problem with this one. All in all, I’d recommend this product over the m200 like 100%! Not a professional so can’t compare with dslr cameras and stuff but here’s my 2 cents. I depended on reviews to buy so I’m paying it forward."

Too bad it gave up within an hour or two of opening the box, taking it's first shots. Gave it about 12 hours laying separated, with battery charging, to see if it would at least attempt powering on (idk I guess this is a thing? Saw a YouTube video suggesting this...) and, well sort of as expected, it still won't power on. Not sure I want to get this replaced, and risk having the same thing happening, especially as it seems to be fairly common (not only with the M50 MK2, but other Canons as well.)"

Very excited to have this as my first camera! I love its size. It is much smaller than a DSLR. In my case it is better because it is more portable, making it easier to use. This reduces the friction of the whole process so I end up using it a lot more often.

Will update once I become more acquainted with the camera."

I'll divide my review into parts or I'll never be able to make it cohesive enough.

Build Quality:
-----------------------------------
The first thing you notice when you take it out of the box is the build quality of the body. It 'feels' solid. The top and bottom plate is all metal. The middle of camera is metal wrapped over by a rubbery texture that makes it great to hold.
Then you notice the lens. As someone who's been using Nikkor DX 35mm 1.8 prime (which is a great lens, tbh), the all metal lens body was a revelation. Yeah, it makes things heavier. But the weight gives it some welcome heft when you handle it. No, Fuji is not the only company that makes metal lenses. But yes, fuji lenses are extremely well made and can go toe to toe with any lens's build quality out there.

Design
-----------------------------------
This is one of the better looking cameras on market. Obviously, the looks are subjective. But I've yet to come across a reviewer who had bad things to say about the looks of this camera. The dials are 'retro-looking', but actually make things way easier than the mode dials. Again, I am writing from experience. Aperture priority and Shutter priority are easy enough to understand on most cameras. But when you want to control both Aperture and Shutter, while leaving ISO on auto, and when you want to customise ISO too for that one shot, having dedicated dials saves time.

The dials make the entire experience extremely tactile. It 'makes you wanna shoot'.

Kit Lens
-----------------------------------
This is hands down the best kit zoom lens you can get with any camera of any brand. I mean, look it up. Firstly, the lens goes to f2.8 with 18mm. Second, it's all metal with classy optics. While most kit lenses cost around 10k - 25k standalone, this kit lens costs upwards of 45k most of the times.

And the quality of the pictures matches the build. Many photographers have praised this lens, and it's easy to see why. There's little distortion and I didn't find any color fringing. This lens takes you places. Literally.

That said, I plan to purchase a prime soon. Not because I don't like my kit lens (I love it) but prime fits my shooting style better. When I'm not lazily trying to zoom at things while sitting in chair, I find that I make better shots. Also, this lens isn't weather resistant, which is a bit of a downer. But hey, it's still the best kit lens there is.

Functionality
-----------------------------------
X-T3 gives you a lot of customisability. The 'Q' button gives you a bunch of quick settings. And you can customise the placement of each of these settings and even swap them out for other things you might find more useful. For even quicker changes, there are dedicated function buttons as well as touch screen gestures, all of which are customisable. I feel customisation is one of those things that differentiate a workhorse from a beginner camera. You can adjust things to make your workflow easier.

Having two memory card slots is awesome. I use one for raws and other for jpegs. That way, I have my raws to process, but if something goes south with my primary card, I still have my backups for jpegs. Thankfully, when I delete a raw, the camera also lets me delete its corresponding jpeg from card 2 automatically (you can turn this off) so both my cards are consistent with each other.

One of the not-so-good things here is placement of playback and delete buttons. Everything is on right side, but these two buttons are all the way on top left corner, making it extremely hard to access. Plus I end up triggering the EVF sensor every time I do that. Thankfully, I was able to assign one of the function buttons to playback, so I don't have to live with Fuji's questionable choices.

Screens
-----------------------------------
Yep, this camera has two. If this is your first mirrorless (as it was for me), know that there is no optical view finder (that little lens on top of camera you use to see things). Instead, it's a small, extremely high resolution OLED screen. That means everything you can do from main touch screen, you can do in EVF. Changing settings, jumping through menus etc. It also means camera shows you how your photos are gonna look. So if you apply a film simulation (like B/W Acros), the live view in EVF reflects that.

The touch screen in this camera is usable, although I find myself never using the touch screen features. I sometimes use joystick to select focus, but mostly keep the focus in center and just lock and recompose.

Battery
-----------------------------------
There's no two ways about this. The battery is not very good on this camera. I mean, it's not abysmal. It got me two days of outdoors with on and off shooting in performance mode, with me turning off my camera when there were long pauses between shots. So if you're thinking of shooting your next vacation with it, no, it won't fail you in middle of day.
That said, the battery is no where near my old Nikon D5300. This is mostly because of that high res EVF that I primarily use. Expect to charge the battery overnight or every two nights when you're shooting and you should be fine. They supply a wall charger too, although the camera lets you charge battery in-body using a USB-C cable.

Accessories
-----------------------------------
I got a 16 gb SD card. Put it in slot two as my JPEG backup. Had to purchase a 64 gb high speed card for slot 1 for raws. The raw files of this camera are consistently over 50 mb, so the space fills quickly.

They also gave me a camera bag. It has room enough for everything in box, plus one extra lens when/if you buy one. That said, the bag is not good at all. The top flap doesn't have a chain and is closed only through a hook. The belt on this hook loosens every time you life the bag using top handle. The strap is also not long enough, making me wear this camera pretty awkwardly around my body.
I plan to switch this bag out soon too.

Final thoughts
-----------------------------------
Do you need a 1 lac+ camera to make good photos? No. Great photographers can take better photos on an instax than I can take on my X-T3. However, I'd argue that if you have the money to spend, and find a camera (doesn't have to be this) that ignites your passion and makes you wanna go out and experiment, shoot and enjoy photography, then by all means, get one. You certainly won't regret the purchase.

As always, before buying this camera, do some research. I love this, but it may not be the right one for your needs. Look at Sony's alpha series, Canon's R series and Nikon's Z series. Most importantly, look at the lens selections. When you buy a camera, you're buying into a system. You are not gonna use canon lenses on fuji, so make sure which ever system you wanna get into, has the lenses you need. That said, Fuji has a very good lens selection. The best part is that they don't have any full frame cameras (at all). So they focus pretty hard on their APS-C lens lineup, which has already made it one of the best out there.

Go shoot!"

To give a little background, I started shooting videos on canon 600d, have used Canon 5d Mark iv on rent for some projects, I've helped a company setup their video studio 3 years back and made them buy Panasonic Gh4 as that was the best option available back then in this range and they wanted a 4k camera. Last year, I also got a chance to shoot with a really expensive Sony camera, FS7. That immediately made me a Sony fan and for my personal use I had almost finalized a6500. Just then Fuji announced xt3, I had already heard good reviews of XH1, and because one part of my mind was tired of seeing everyone on YouTube using Sony cameras and the difficulty in getting accurate skin tones sometimes, I watched almost every video available on xt3 on YouTube, and was convinced that this is something special. Followed my heart and bought this along with fujinon 23mm f1.4, best investment of my video production career so far. You can't go wrong with this.
Not providing tech specs as anyone who has even bothered to look up for Fuji camera for video work already knows a thing or two about it. The only issue people have is regarding trust in the brand considering it's forte has been just photography in the past. All I can say is I've just completed 1 year with xt3, don't see myself upgrading to anything else anytime soon, and to put things in perspective I bought the body only for 1,17,000/- INR last year, below 1 lakh it is a steal."

This is my so called upgrade from XT1 but I still love the XT1, the colors from XT1 are more to my liking than XT3. But XT3 is super fast, supports two SD Cards and the Fuji X Raw Studio with accurate color reproduction and detail. The XT1 RAW files were always a mess to work with in Lightroom, that was one or the biggest reasons I purchased XT3, the RAW conversation using X Raw Studio is as good as JPEGS out of camera. Unfortunately X Raw Studio doesn't support files from XT1. If you are a fan of accurate film style colors, and easy and super quick to use dial style settings. Fuji X System is for you."

- Very good custom-ability. Menu is really good
- AF is really good. Face tracking amazing
- 4K Video at 60Fps.....OMG!!!
- Film simulations are amazing
- I use CaptureOne for Raw image processing. Really good tool.
- Paired with 23mm F2 WR Fujinon lens for effective 35mm output
- I like how ISO, Shutter and Aperture controls are easily used and locked.
- Build quality really good. Didnt expect this
- Been enjoying the camera since i got it
- Made a mistake shooting JPEG instead of RAW recently.....but JPEGS were still amazing
- Dual SD Card function is brilliant
- Manual focusing is like childs play....so easy with the camera highlight functions

Now the Bad....battery life is bad. Example, fully charged, 92 Images + 4 (120fps) Vids @ 3 sec each and battery is dead. This is with LCD turned OFF and using EVF only with eye sensor (the best for power saving).....looks like i need a few spare batteries....as this is not a deal breaker for me.

First a little background. I’m a hobbyist photographer who has been doing hobbyist photography for about 25 years since I was in my teens. My first interaction with cameras was my father’s Asahi Pentax 35mm film camera which he bought in England back in the 60s. By the time I started to use that camera, it was older than I was!

In my early 20s, I decided to step up the game and bought a Panasonic fixed lens “SLR look” camera. That was 1” sensor if I’m not mistaken. I took some pretty decent photos with that digital handheld camera.

Back in 2013, I told myself that I’d upgrade once more and take a stab at the DSLRs. So I invested in a Canon Rebel T3i which came with the kit lens, 18-55mm. I also added a 70-300mm telephoto zoom lens to my arsenal and used this setup for 5 years. I’d shoot anything from my kids at home, to dance concerts to archery events and really maximized the Canon in many ways. I started to shoot in P-mode for about one year and then mostly shoot in Aperture Priority Mode, with some shoots done in Manual Mode. The T3i was a great starter camera.

In 2017, I decided that I wanted to upgrade my camera and this is where things got confused. I looked at full frame cameras in Canon, full frame mirrorless in Sony, Micro 4/3, and APS-C cameras in almost every manufacturer, except Nikon (reason being, if I was upgrading in to a APS-C DSLR, I told myself I’d stick with the Canon). Believe me when I say that I had researched cameras for more than 18 months before deciding to invest in the X-T3. I then narrowed down my search to mirrorless systems. A friend of mines let me use his Olympus OMD-M5 for a few hours. Two things that struck me… How light the mirrorless was compared to my Canon and the ability to see what the photo looks like in the EVF or on the LCD with different ISO, Shutter Speeds and Aperture settings. Looking for the mirrorless, the search then spread to Sony (both full frame and APS-C), micro 4/3 in Panasonic and Olympus and of course Fujifilm.

I eventually ruled out Sony. I felt that the “starter” Full Frames from Sony lacked some of the better features that the other, similarly priced APS-C cameras possessed. Plus, I thought the Sony lenses were too expensive. Micro 4/3 systems were inveigling me but that small sensor capabilities in low light, even with fast lenses was a bit iffy (for me).

Eventually, in early 2018, I settled on either the X-T20 or the X-T2. The first feature that I was drawn to was the retro styling… the full manual adjustments on shutter speed, ISO and exposure. And the manual aperture ring adjustments on equipped lenses. Drool!!!! I was taken back to my teens when I was shooting on my dad’s Pentax and how excited I was to see how my photos would come out when I played around with different settings, not to mention the disappointment I would feel when I saw many over exposed or under exposed photos. For me, shooting on the Canon did not give that experience and while I learnt to navigate the buttons quite well for shooting in Aperture Priority or even Manual, the Pentax experience was always top notch.

The Fujinon lenses also appealed to me. All reviews I read alluded to how sharp images were. And the prices of the lenses, while quite steep, were still cheaper than some of its counterparts in other manufacturers.

I think in early 2018, I eventually settled on the X-T20 as it had many of the features of the X-T2 with the touchscreen. Then came July 2018 and I saw that the price on the X-T2 dropped to $1,099 a mere $200 more than the X-T20. The X-T2 then became the camera of choice. In early September, my decisions were stymied by the launch of the X-H1 as I began to wonder whether Fujifilm were heading in a different direction for IBIS. But I told myself that the lenses would be around for a while and that the X-T2 would be the way to go. Mid-September I was about to buy the X-T2 and while looking at a review of a Fujinon lens on dpreview, I saw a post on the new X-T3. I read all I could about the X-T3 and saw that there were introductory offers available on the X-T3 and many of the Fujinon lenses. Eventually I bought the X-T3 along with the Fujinon XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR Lens.

I got the new setup over two days ago. Configured the camera to the way I want it, including back button focus and some customization on the Fn buttons.

This camera is a dream to use. The build quality of the camera is first class and solid. My setup with the 16-55mm lens and the camera is a bit heavy, but that’s a price to pay for quality glass. The camera does indeed feel like the old Pentax and after shooting about 50 pictures, it is so effortless to simply turn a dial or a ring to adjust some aspect of the exposure. No more fiddling with this dial and that button and looking at a LCD screen to see the exposure settings before taking a picture, or half pressing the shutter button to see the same information in the view finder (that’s what I had to do with the Canon).

The X-T3 is heavily customizable. Every setting is easily changed from the intuitive menu. One small complaint is that some of the menu settings are not that self-explanatory or clear so you would need the manual to decipher what a change in that setting does. Maybe in a firmware update Fujifilm could add a little on screen explanation on menu settings so the user can understand the change being made without having to revert to the manual.

Which brings me to firmware. My camera was shipped with revision 1.0 of the firmware. I downloaded the latest firmware from Fuji’s website and followed the instructions to upgrade on the camera. The actual upgrade takes less than 90 seconds. So I would suggest that once you get your camera, perform the firmware update before doing anything else.

The EVF is crystal clear, and to be honest, there’s no difference to me in using this EVF as compared to the pentaprism on the Canon. I found that the transition was seamless. The LCD is fun to use although I have found that sometimes my nose would cause a change of setting, especially a change in AF. So I just disable touchscreen AF.

I tried a 120fps slow motion video capture of my daughter jumping. This is an awesome feature that I know I’ll love at those archery shoots. While the camera touts some impressive video features, only with time will I be able to unlock that potential. And speaking of archery, the 20 fps and 30 fps burst shooting would be great once I put it to the test. I did a few frames at these speeds and the camera was quite fast so this is another feature that I’m excited to use on the archery range.

The AF is spot on fast. What I love about how I have the camera configured is that with back button autofocus I can leave the AF in Manual mode but still have AF-S or AF-C by either touching or holding the AF-L button (which I have configured as “AF-ON”).

I have attached some photos to the review. All but the two photos of the X-T3 alongside the Asahi Pentax were out of camera JPEGs. The X-T3 alongside the Asahi Pentax were taken with my phone to give you an idea of the retro styling and the retro look with the silver and black. The photos show you the background blur you can get – that’s the lens mind you. But Image Quality looks great for out of camera JPEGs. The amount of detail is amazing with this camera and lens. Look at the photo of the lemon and all the imperfections you see on the skin! The picture of the willow was intentionally underexposed as I tried to show just how bad the weather was. And that chicken was on the grill while I was taking the photos. It was about 75% done but still looks delicious. You will see that there is a picture of some ants on an orchid leaf. Well for that picture, I was using AF-C mode. It was a challenge to get a fast moving ant in the focus point but once I did and locked on, the camera kept focus on the ant to the top for a few frames, until it disappeared or I moved.

I’ve only had this camera for a few days but already love the combination of the lens and the camera. I can tell that this would be a great investment. After 18+ months of research and dawdling, I am glad that I took the time to research my options and bite the bullet with this X-T3."

In my world, that is. Not a gizmo or a grown up toy, a tool. I cannot keep up new products or enjoy the sensation of having one’s equipment obsolete two years later.

Forcing the wrong tool to be a surrogate or having an insufficient one, for lack of a better term, sucks tuckus, can be so distracting your productivity is slashed and often negates the positive flow of creativity. Sure, millions of amazing photographs have been taken with terrible cameras, but the aresnal of options with this here X-T3 makes it much easier to do what I find most difficult, capturing what I see in my head and getting it on film... pseudo film.

Megapixels are cute. The configuration possibilities infinite. Metering and autofocus lovely. Design impeccable. Rugged. All boxes checked.

Here is why I’m totally floored by the X-T3....

FINALLY, a digital camera I can use without pining for my F3. I earned my degree in Photojournalism shooting endless rolls of TRI-X, T-Max 3200, actual slide film (great way to learn how film sees light at eight bucks a roll) and color negative when required.

To me, digital cameras were horrible until the D700 opened my, ahem, eyes. Blunt, insufficient useless tools. Convenient, sure, but hamfisted and simply not worth it. After living, eating, sleeping and having a blissful love affair with an 8008s, the F3 + MD-4 combo and then the F5, how could I take fifty steps back? Shutter button delay. Remember that? DX cropping? Befuddling. My 85mm is now what? Destroyed my flow. The D700, an FX body + grip that broke my AMEX (grip a must) felt good ten years ago. Obsolete eight years ago. I’ve been nursing it, but we fell out of synch.

FUJIFILM

The X-Pro2 got me back in the game. It’s perfect. Converted after 25 years of Nikon loyalty. However, that means I had to collect new glass. I’ve always shot prime @ 85mm, 35mm and a Wide (20, 24 or, yawn, 28). Gathered those (FUJINON 14, 23 AND 56)...

SECOND BODY. Changing lenses when doing documentary (inc. events like weddings) is laborious, conspicuous, an unwelcome respite and messy. Thus, second body. Which one? The X-Pro2 is my first rangefinder and has a special usefulness. My second needed to be equally effective. I chose the X-T3 (plus battery grip and simple grip - both worth every dime).

It’s now Day Three with the X-T3 and I am in love. It will enable me to produce the work my imagination conjures up. “Why?’, you ask..

It feels like a 4:5 scale F3 (with grip) or a even a classic take on the D700 at 3:4 scale. Tools I know. Tools I love. Tools that don’t make me think about knob fiddling or hunting through designed-by-mathematicians menus.

Except this one has an entire camera shop and darkroom built right in. After a few hours I now have seven custom modes ranging from film noir to oversaturated Velvia to 70s soft portrait. All the Fujifilm cameras have this, yes. Being able to SEE IN BLACK AND WHITE while I’m shooting in black and white doubled what little ‘talent’ I have. No longer do I have to mentally convert and calculate how the film reacts to the world seen through the lens of an SLR. Pause and think about that. My palette is grayscale. Color distracts me.

WHY I LOVE THE X-T3...

Flip out screen.
Touch screen.
Bluetooth remote and transfer.
Fast, fast, fast focusing.
Joystick.
USB-C (thanks Tim Cook)
Everything Fujifilm (just the route I took)
Software evolution (similar, but not the same firmware as the x-pro2)
With battery grip it’s 100% capable of enabling you to apply your Talent (Eye) shooting riots, sports, action, war, protests, more action, more sports. Fast made faster. Ruggedly rugged. Having a robust camera opens doors and wins trust because subjects recognize you as a professional.
And so much more.

This is the camera that finally allows me to accept digital, forget about digital and shoot unhindered.

Buy it. Buy lots of batteries. The metal grip makes it much easier to hold. The battery grip gets an A.

As a tool, it will be treated as such. I’m curious how it will stand up over time. Picking it up mid-review, I think it’ll be just fine.

Can we slow down on technological evolution? This is enough. I’m good."

Whoah. I was not prepared to be as impressed by the X-T3 as I was. It is truly a special camera. It has almost any feature you could ask for in a camera today. It is definitely on par with the Sony A7III and any other high-end mirrorless camera. The only difference being its APS-C sensor size instead of full-frame. Ultimately, that was the game breaker for me because of my shooting style, wanting as much bokeh as I can get regardless of lens.

Speaking of lenses, I used the Fujinon 35mm f/1.4 and the 16-55 f/2.8. Both lenses were phenomenal and matched the superior build quality of the X-T3.

The auto-focusing on this camera is INSANE. It has Eye-Detect/Tracking AF and almost never misses. I can't tell you how satisfying it is to nail focus on the eye instead of the eye-lashes or nose. However, it is lacking eye-detection on animals, which is something Sony, Panasonic, Canon, and maybe even Nikon mirrorless systems all offer. I am sure there will be a firmware update to support this eventually. But, it would seriously make this the best AF system available if you could track your dog or cat as well. (niche, but still prevalent in today's Prosumer market).

As far as build goes, you can't beat it. It feels so durable and without any expenses paid. The combination between metal, yes metal (not plastic), all around and the faux-leather grip is truly stunning. The dials are fun and such, but I literally never used them. I set my camera up to use normal function buttons and dials that all cameras have.

Speaking of function buttons: this camera has about 9 different buttons you can program to do any of about 50 functions. Additionally, you can program 4 actions on the touch screen as well, bringing the total up to 13 different quick function controls. In reality, you actually can get 17 different controllable functions if you use the dedicated shutter, iso, exposure compensation dials as well as the aperture ring on all fuji lenses. I have never experienced a camera that allows for so many micro adjustments to be made manually without having to do a certain combination of buttons.

Being a mirrorless APS-C camera, it is very small. Too small for me. I had to buy a grip to add to it, just to comfortably hold onto it, especially with that rather large 16-55 lens. But, I have decently large hands and was coming off of the Nikon D750 which has an enormous grip on it. The pro for its size is its ability to travel very easily as well as walk around all day holding onto it.

I will also add that this camera produces amazing, moody colors, has incredible video capabilities, and is one of the best cameras I have ever used. Sadly, Fuji has no intention of making a full-frame camera, so I have switched back to the Nikon family.

Who is this camera for:
-Moody/punchy wedding photographers or videographers that don't mind having less bokeh.
-Street photographers
-Anyone who grew up using vintage style cameras and want some nostalgia in their lives
-Anyone looking to use photography as a career.
-Anyone looking to switch to mirrorless, but not spend $2000+ just for a body and then fork over thousands for lenses.
-Vloggers who don't mind an external monitor"

I am a professional designer, musician and visual artist, and I used it for heavy filming in a 3-camera setup for two days following the day I received it (even though I didn't yet understand all of the settings!) and am very pleased with the results (I filmed 17 videos in two days and edited them all into a 30 min concert in Final Cut Pro X on the third day). The amount of settings/options is a bit overwhelming for a newbie, but there are a LOT of YouTube videos from seasoned pros available specifically for this camera model (XT3) so if you're new to it, just plan to spend some time watching videos. I opted for the XT3 over the XT4 for two key reasons - 1) I needed to be able to remove the door that covers the USB-C port and mic/headphone jacks as I often shoot from a fixed location and have external audio hooked up; the XT4 does not have the headphone jack, only the USB-C which I needed to supplement the battery; 2) I decided I could live with the OIS (stabilization) only being on the lens rather than the camera body. There is not a lot of difference between these two models otherwise.

The seller shipped quickly and it actually arrived earlier than stated, however, my package was missing the North American adapter plug for the charger (which is really cheapy). It included the European one which doesn't help, but I had my own adapters that let me use it anyway. This wasn't the seller's fault - the package was shrink-wrapped by Fujifilm so they didn't know anything was missing.

PROS

- The ""physical/analog"" settings/dials on the top of the camera so you don't have to menu-dive all the time.

- Solid, high-quality build and feel.

- Amazing support from Fujifilm Canada in Ontario when I had a question (immediate email response after submitting a contact form on the website).

- Gorgeous colour and plentiful options for auto or manual use in every mode; an excellent hybrid without needing two cameras to do my work.

- Excellent programmable function keys.

- Lots of not-too-expensive lenses available (when compared to some other brands)

CONS

- Battery life not amazing (but I am using a USB-C charger along with the in-camera battery to supplement when shooting in fixed location); expensive OEM batteries.

- Tilt rather than flip-out screen (the XT4 has flip-out) which might be less practical for vloggers, but you could add a small mirror attachment on top (15$) or use a small monitor if you really needed this. I think the flip-out is also at risk of being broken off - the tilt on this one detaches on the left side, too, so it can be viewed from the side. Not a deal breaker for me.

- For people with large hands and not accustomed to a modern, smaller 35mm, this size camera can make you feel a bit clumsy. I added a SmallRig L-bracket with wooden handle to allow me a better grip and the ability to add mic and other items if I like. It helps keep me from accidentally bumping the many dials and buttons."

It was right about the time the X-T2 came out, but because I wasn't sure I'd be that into it as a hobby, I decided not to wait for the new model. I've been happy with the X-T1, but when the X-T3 came I felt there were a number of reasons to upgrade and I'm glad I did. No camera is perfect and discussions based on brand loyalty can get pretty heated, but here is what I like about the Fuji X-T series of cameras. I feel image quality is very good and even better with the X-T3. I shoot in RAW format and edit the shots in Lightroom. Unfortunately, Lightroom isn't be best RAW processor for Fuji RAW files. I'm experimenting with Capture One's free Fuji raw processor to see if it's better. I'll still edit in Lightroom after I convert the files in Capture One. I like the manual dials on the Fuji's. With a quick glance I can see what the ISO, shutter, F stop, and exposure compensation are set at and can adjust them before I even turn on the camera. The weather sealing on the camera body and certain lenses is also a plus if you shoot in inclement weather. I also like the high resolution view finder for seeing how changing the settings will affect the shot before I press the shutter. Not having ""in body lens stabilization"" (IBIS) isn't a problem for me at this point since most of what I shoot is landscape and I use a tripod when needed, plus the lenses I currently use have stabilization. Not having it also keeps the camera body more compact which is a plus for me. Now I've only had the X-T3 for one day and have only had a couple of hours to take it out and get some shots. I use the bracketing feature a fair amount and like the fact that, unlike the X-T1, I can take more than 3 shots. I also like the focus bracketing feature, the last shot is an example. I focused on the moss at the bottom of the frame and the camera took a series of shots where it changed the point of focus until it reaches infinity. I then used Photoshop to assemble the shots so that it's in focus from the closest point to infinity. Won't use this feature all the time, but I can see that it could be handy in certain situations. Focus stacking is something you can do manually, but this makes it pretty convenient. I feel that Fuji makes a well built camera and have great lenses, but they aren't inexpensive. And while the lens selection is getting better and there seems to be more third party lenses available all the time (all of which are manual focus which I don't mind since the X-T series of mirrorless cameras offer focus peaking) I wish there were more options. Fuji has a roadmap for lenses, so it's just a matter of time and patience. I can't say if this is a worthwhile upgrade from the X-T2 or any other brand of camera that you might own, but for me, it was well worth it."

FujiFilm proved them wrong! I am an avid photographer, having used everything from Pentax 35mm to CanoNikon digital. The last body I owned was a full frame. Speaking of full frame, everyone seems to tout Sony! While Sony is no doubt a major player and does well. FujiFilm is holding its own and has an exceptional X series lineup.

The little X-T3 is powerful, 26mp with a host of impressive features. I believe this is the X sweet spot right now based on features and pricing. For me its a good carry around all the time camera. I don't have the bulk of the bigger camera bodies, lenses, etc. APS-C sensors have come a long way and for me it is ideal. I am a hobbyist, having done some semi-professional work. The X-T3 will help me keep things simple and hopefully avoid GAS (gear acquisition syndrome).

I had no idea that FujiFilm is known for quality optics. in fact the company makes high end cine lenses! The current X lens selection is great. Now if Sigma and Tamron get into the mix, it will be even better. There are also plenty of Asian manufacturers, such as Viltrox and 7artisans that make manual focus lenses for the X system. You can also adapt pretty much any kind of vintage lens using adapters. Think about all the amazing vintage lenses out there.

The X-T3 can do it all! I love the retro design with dials on top and weather proofing rounds up this beauty. From The Verge: ""The command dials on the front and back turn with an even more satisfying click. None of the buttons feel loose. And the magnesium alloy body feels as sturdy and solidly built as ever. The X-T3’s left-side door houses a mic input, headphone jack, USB Type-C port, and HDMI. Dual SD slots occupy the right side. Having USB-C here is really nice. The camera does seem to charge faster, depending on what it’s plugged into, and you can use a supported battery pack to keep it juiced up on the go. The built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth make it easy to offload images from camera to smartphone."" Essentially, everything you find on the bigger camera bodies, is all here in a nice compact offering. You can read all the reviews on the interwebs.

EDIT: I really liked the camera, however lenses are pricey. The lack of 3rd party manufacturers is also a concern. With full frame being the catch all, I am not completely convinced yet."

Everything that Mirrorless Should be. And only for $999.",2020-08-19,"The title says most of what I have to say of the XT-3, but I can easily go into detail. At the time of this review, the XT-3 was selling for $999 body only. This is through the perspective of a photographer who doesn't shoot video.

Form Factor
Of the key features of mirrorless design that Full Frame unfortunately misses is the aspect of compact bodies and lenses. Sure, full frame mirrorless bodies are very small compared to their DSLR counterparts, but the lenses are as large or even larger. This is something that Fujifilm cameras have nailed. The XT-3 is slim and light, and the lenses (which are also fantastic) are robust. The first party lenses that Fuji provides are built to last with weather sealing and tack sharpness offered at a reasonable price.

Stills Photography Experience.
From the moment you grab the XT-3, you can certainly tell that it is designed for photographers in mind. Those tactile dials, though seemingly archaic in the digital age, provide a level of control that doesn't take away from the act of photography. Everything you need to take a photo is with you in the moment through those dials.

Auto focus is very good, I'd even say it comes very close to Sony's cameras. Eye tracking, continuous focus, and the general speed and responsiveness even in low light is absolutely great.

Film simulations, which is to say the in body JPG renderings, are a fun little add on. I usually shot in RAW when shooting Sony, but Fujifilm has convinced me that its JPG files have value. They're perfect for when you want to upload to instagram in a heartbeat without having to spend the time editing.

The XT-3 is amazing value for a stills photographer who wants to get into Fuji's ecosystem. Its about 80 percent the camera the XT-4 is for just over half its price."

My only drawbacks: battery life is quite bad, so buy extra batteries and chargers and plan to take a few extras on your shoots.

Doesn’t have IBIS and Lens stabilization only has minimal benefits, but camera performs really well at higher ISO and RAW format will help you recover some lost details when underexposed.

The app does make transferring images to your phone very easy but most of the app features otherwise are borderline broken.

I’ve had some issues with face/eye detect autofocus when shooting complex videos such as outdoors but I’m newer to this and could be operator error that can be fixed by adjusting settings. Most the time it’s fantastic though!

If you’re new to Fuji there is a bit of a skill curve here but it’s the kind that will make you a better photographer and end up falling in love with this system!

XT4 is superior in many ways but if it’s out of your price range this is a fantastic option you won’t be disappointed with!"

Prior to the X-T3 I was using an X-T20 for a couple years, and prior to that, and X-E2. The X-T3 biggest performance upgrade is the improvement in auto focus. The most challenging subject I photograph is my extremely active and erratic 11 month old. Prior to his birth, the X-T20 served me great for my slower focusing needs. Part of the challenge photographing my son is the lack of predictability and the auto focus helps to make up for my lack of skill using continuous AF.

Having shot with a full frame Canon 6d and Sony A7 series cameras, the Fuji system is nice due to the large selection of dedicated high quality native APS-C lenses. I enjoy shooting landscapes, and the smaller sized lenses really help reduce the weight of my kit. When making the decision to upgrade to the X-T3, I spent a long time considering going back to full frame, but the weight savings won out.

While this was not a top tier deciding factor, I really enjoy the styling of Fujifilm cameras. The retro styling just looks good and the access to the buttons and dials allows for me to adjust my camera for changing environments without even having to turn it on. The one major downside is the poor battery life, but this can be offset by carry a couple spares or using a grip. I carry spares to keep the kit small and light."

I am eager to try it out in the field tomorrow but initial impressions are positive.

I purchased and used the Fuji X-T3 for 5 days. I returned the camera for a refund today. I also own the Fuji Xt2 and Xt1 along with 7 of the Fuji lenses. I love Fuji stuff for the image and build quality and small form factor. I hope my disappointing experience with the Xt3 can be attributed to early build issues that get solved with more manufacturing time. My issues are as follows:
1. Everytime I switched on the camera, I received a message to use the NP-W126S battery, which was the battery loaded in the body and the same one the camera was shipped with. Even substituting another spare NP-W126S battery gave me the same warning every time the camera was switched on. Not only was this annoying, it also made it impossible to shoot images until the message cleared out.
2. Each time that I swapped out the battery, the camera lost all its initial settings like date, time and connection with the Fuji app.
3. The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was when the auto focus preferences that I stored were lost during one of these battery swaps and I wound up shooting a day’s worth of images completely out of focus.
I did perform a firmware update prior to using this camera, so I could only conclude that I had issues that would require more time and patience to solve than I possess. I must admit that I liked the way the camera handled, particularly for action shooting, so I hope my experience was an isolated example. Nevertheless, this was a frustrating experience for me."

Much more intuitive/options for manual knob control and within the menu itself. File sizes are considerably smaller than the Canon 5D Mark IV (1.5 g per minute in 60fps vs canon 4 g in 30fps which is as high as Canon goes per minute to boot). The Fuji is definitely a more well thought out piece of equipment overall. I had even discussed the camera with a B&H specialist whom had just himself purchased the camera for video and also believes the Fuji X-T3 to be the best option on the market. The only 2 downsides I have experienced are slightly less low light capability than the Canon 5D Mark IV or III for that matter and the 4:3 crop factor -neither of which is by any means a deal breaker but it would be nice to see no crop and better low light in their next rendition. One small thing for me is while the LED screen is better than the canon and articulates unlike the canon, it does not flip fully up just tilts and doesn't not flip back which is I like on the screen I have on my old Canon 70D. The screen however is clearer and brighter than the canon 5D and the look of the video is something I like. I will update once I have more experience with the camera but so far, I am very happy.

Have owned (and still own) several of their X-series of cameras. I do a lot of indoor family/pets photography and travel photography.

Secondly, there are so many great and comprehensive reviews about the X-T3, that it feels futile to try to do the same. So, instead, I'm going to give you my impressions after nearly a month since purchase.

Things I really like about this camera:
* Articulating touch screen
* Electronic viewfinder
* Autofocus speed
* Autofocus settings
* Customizability
* Ruggedness
* Weather sealing
* Quality of nobs and buttons
* Image sharpness

Things that need work:
* Menu settings are still super unintuitive
* App sync and connection

Things that I'm disappointed about:
* Noise. I could rant about this for days. In essence, it performs horribly at ISOs above 400 (yes, even at something mild like 640 it begins to show some chroma noise). I have compared it with same lens, same subject, same light, same ISO, same aperture and shutter speed using an old X-E2, which is about 5 years old, and in most situations the E2 simply produced a much noise-cleaner picture. I know, the fans will surely cry 'don't pixel peep, just enjoy the camera' but that argument simply doesn't hold any water. You see, unlike other aspects of picture quality noise is pernicious and pervasive. If affects *everything* and there is no amount of Lightroom you can throw at it, if the noise it gets out of the raw file is high. I can hear fans also saying 'you probably got a bad copy' funny you should say that, because after a colleague got his, we swamped bodies and saw the same thing. Simply put, for a camera which was built in 2018 and costs $1500 it exhibits an unacceptable amount of noise.
* Front side button placement: I don't care how delicate your fingers are and how dexterous your are. You *will* unintentionally press one of the three buttons/nobs Fuji placed in the front of the camera. I had to remove any functionality that was attached to them. It can literally stop you on your tracks while shooting something important. If you do get this camera, first thing you should do is re-program the front facing buttons to do nothing."

The XT-3 does not disappoint! I upgraded to this camera primarily for the improved focus system, video capabilities and weatherproofing. I could not be happier with the performance of the camera. The focusing is so much faster and more accurate and has improved the performance of some of my older Fujinon lenses. Battery life has never been great in the Fuji system but the XT 3 seems to be a bit better than the XT20- just know you will always need extra batteries on hand with Fuji cameras, but for me that was not a dealbreaker given the trade off of amazing performance. After this camera I know I will never go back to DLSR. Maybe more camera than I needed as a hobbyist/enthusiast but it’s definitely bringing my photography up to the next level-and it is such a fun camera to shoot with I find myself taking it everywhere. My favorite combination lens is the 10-24mm f4.0 because I really think this camera excels at landscape photography. That being said, the 35 mm F2.0 pretty much lives on the body.

Me parece una cámara espectacular en todos los sentidos. Soy un usuario que en principio vengo de una cámara superior ( Nikon d750 ) por ser Full Frame y tener un sensor más grande. Dicho esto, nada más lejos de la realidad.

La XT3 supera en todos los sentidos a mí antigua máquina. La velocidad del enfoque es algo exagerado, enfoca hasta cuándo piensas que no lo va a hacer.

El rendimiento del sensor es buenísimo. Da unos archivos muy ricos en rango dinámico y el color de fuji personalmente me encanta. Un 10 en este aspecto

Lo único que tengo que decir en contra es que en mi unidad, cuando l pantalla se queda en negro tomando una fotografía hay un pixel muerto. No es nada del otro mundo ya que no aparece en las fotografías y solo aparece en el LCD pero está ahí, y para un ojo exigente puede ser un engorro.

Por todo lo demás es la cámara perfecta. Si se usa con buenas lentes es una herramienta profesional que nada tiene que envidiar a otros equipos muchísimo más caros."

I had shot Canon L Lenses and DSLR Pro bodies for 20 years and was getting ready to switch to mirrorless.
I bought the X-T3 from Amazon and a 56mm 1.2 lens. I was not disappointed and sold my canon gear on ebay.
Tack sharp focus, cutting edge colors and tech. Also a great price.

The camera and lens look to be well made and of solid construction. A little heavier than I expected 1kg approx. but great quality. Also after the latest firmware upgrade the XT3 is nearly as good as the XT4 camera without the IBIS and a lot cheaper.
Due to the covid 19 Lockdown restrictions I have not been able to get out and take some photographs, but the few I have taken look to be of great quality.
I am still working my way through all the different settings that are available, and I think it will take some time to learn how to use this camera fully.
All in all this is a great camera and lens kit that I would recommend to any keen photographer."

The video features of this camera are exceptional. the 4k abilites shouldnt be on a camera this price. i do freelance video on the side and this camera can do everything my client asks.

The Fuji colour profiles are incredible, the image straight out of the camera is stunning, no need for post-production edit on alot of photos.

I wont list all the features, i encourage you to lookup a ton of youtube reviews. for the price, there is no comparison. This will be my main camera for many many years. Not to mention, Fuji has some of the best glass on the market.

lastly, the looks of this camera. Wow. So retro. I get stopped all the time by peopel who are stunned by it.

Get this camera, you wont be disappointed."

Noise not an issue up to ISO6400
- Very good custom-ability. Menu is really good
- AF is really good. Face tracking amazing
- 4K Video at 60Fps.....OMG!!!
- Film simulations are amazing
- I use CaptureOne for Raw image processing. Really good tool.
- Paired with 23mm F2 WR Fujinon lens for effective 35mm output
- I like how ISO, Shutter and Aperture controls are easily used and locked.
- Build quality really good. Didnt expect this
- Been enjoying the camera since i got it
- Made a mistake shooting JPEG instead of RAW recently.....but JPEGS were still amazing
- Dual SD Card function is brilliant
- Manual focusing is like childs play....so easy with the camera highlight functions

Now the Bad....battery life is bad. Example, fully charged, 92 Images + 4 (120fps) Vids @ 3 sec each and battery is dead. This is with LCD turned OFF and using EVF only with eye sensor (the best for power saving).....looks like i need a few spare batteries....as this is not a deal breaker for me."

It is absolutely amazing with the ETERNA film simulation. But if you color grade your footage, it is even BETTER. For photo, Fujifilm is famous for their color science. X-T3 provides a number film simulations for JPG color rendering. They are all very good. Other great features include:

10-bit 4:2:0 recording on SD card
10-bit 4:2:2 recording to external
F-Log
4K video at 60 fps
Fast start up time
Face/eye detection for focusing and metering
Panorama
Focus stacking
Weather-sealed
2 SD card slots
Wireless connection to phones or tablets
Camera can charge and operate at the same time with an external power bank

The only weakness of X-T3 is lacking of in-body image stabilization. However, when I do video, I always use a gimbal anyway. So it is not a big deal for me. Finally, I have to say, the X-T3 is the best camera that I have ever bought and I absolutely love it. It makes photography and cinematography so much more fun!"

But i liked the retro style. Lens quality is the best i have seen so far in a kit lens. Battery is great but i ordered a spare. I am learning photography but i would say its a bit expensive for amateurs/learners - i absolutely love the viewfinder, as i had seen other competitors’ as well. Got 2 memory card slots, so thats nice. Yet to click and learn settings but whatever i clicked so far was damn good! Waiting for some good weather to go out!! Just a tip : Do not get mixed up in full frame vs crop. If you are tyring to : means u really do not know much about photography. You can get equally amazing shots with a aps c. Try the camera if possible in person and remember a basic dslr can also produce amazing pictures and there is NO bad camera.!!"

- Gluing the eyepiece back onto the camera (3 times).
- fixing the diopter adjustment dial after I hit it putting the camera back in the bag.
- Correcting the exposure compensation dial after accidentally moving it.
These tasks were driving me crazy and when I saw the XT-3 had corrected all three problems it was an easy decision. PLUS there are a ton of other upgrades. I don't use it for video now, but maybe in the future. I use it with two primes (16mm + 56mm) that are the crown jewels in the Fuji lens line. I bought it with the battery grip and the combination of the two are soooo much smaller than my old Nikon rig.

Anything more than a single raindrop should make u Very nervous. I had this verified by a Fuji pro photographer on Instagram .
Anyway, this camera is so much different than the XT2! It’s face detection and processing speed is noticeably better. Many fewer blurred photos due to slow autofocus on moving faces. The touch screen is an improvement and there are lots of new controls to learn but all for the better, really. Photos I’ve included are not edited. Now I just need some more lenses and probably a rain cover . Photo quality not that different from tx2"

Charles,Love this camera!,2018-10-01,"I purchased a used XT-1 a little over a year ago and found myself hooked into the Fuji system. I consider myself a hobbyist not a pro by any means. This XT-3 is obviously a HUGE upgrade from the XT-1. It's extremely snappy in everything it does. The buttons and dials have a more tactile feel compared to my XT-1 as well. I also really love the weight of the camera and how it feels in my hand.

As far as image quality and low light performance - noticeably better than the XT-1 (obviously), but I really need more time to run it through its paces. I'll update this review accordingly once I do.

I did try it with my Cactus V6ii Transceivers - they didn't work. Hopefully they get a firmware upgrade pretty soon.

***UPDATE***

Really, if you spec the two next to each other the Fujifilm is much higher. In reality...not sure much is noticeable. I returned it. This is the weird part...I think I got a refurb. I didn't order a refurb, but this did not seem to be factory fresh. There was one problem with it. The eye sensor didn't seem to be working right. Also, there were some tiny white flecks of something on the lens. Not a problem and no signs of wear, but these tiny flecks that factories that focus on high end manufacturing wouldn't really allow. Also, there was supposed to be lens cloth that wasn't in it. Could it have been factory fresh? Maybe, but I got a suspicious vibe and then when the eye view sensor didn't work right, it made me think I might have gotten one that was sent back. However, as usually, amazon handled the return fabulously. Would I recommend it? Meh. If you have money to burn, sure."

I don't make any prints and really just post to social media so this camera is more than enough by any means for someone like myself.. in addition the video is awesome as well.

The video output was disappointing though, HLG 10-bit is not supported yet so you have no ""effective"" way of getting 10-bit ""out of the box"". Then you also need to do some post processing to get the right color grading. In other words don't expect to shoot your kids at the park and then watch them in beautiful vivid color on your NVidia Shield, it's just not designed for that use-case.

Coming from a Panasonic G85, shoot it and watch it seems far easier without any post in between. I don't always shoot video that is worthy of that much effort, sometimes its just my kids messing around.

If you're looking for excellent quality for both video and photo's; and you have the time to do post production this is a fantastic product. I just wish there was a way of shooting high quality usable 10-bit video, that was my main ask of this camera."

No issues. Only complaint I have with this camera is low light capability. I came to Fuji from a Nikon D750 and haven’t looked back, even with the z series. Fujis lenses are just too sharp and good to worry about z series being built up slowly. Also way cheaper with arguable better quality glass. My D750 was incredible at low light. This is The best crop sensor camera at low light but not quite as good as my former ff body. Yet here is the cool thing about Fuji, the low light noise isn’t really noise but grain. I haven’t noticed it looking blotchy or discolored light Sony stuff. All that happens is a film like grain. You could just call it character!"

Issues:
Atomos has sent me two Ninja V's and both experience these identical issues. When turning on the camera, the camera will periodically freeze. Also, when set to 4K, the Ninja V periodically glitches. Because both monitors do the exact same thing, this leads me to believe that this is a rooted Xt-3 issue. To be clear, when not using an external monitor, I haven't had any issues with my Xt-3.

Conclusions:
Both firmwares on both products are up to date. I'm suing supported HDMI cables and SSD's - and yet the problem persists. Either I have a defected Xt-3 unit, or Fujifilm needs to update the firmware functionality when outputting. If Fujifilm sends me another camera or updates the firmware, I'll update my review accordingly. I truly wish I could give it 5 stars, but for my video needs the camera freezing up and glitching (when using Ninja V) is too unreliable to take on productions. I love Fujifilm and hope this issue can get sorted out. As a professional cinematographer and director, I can't justify having unreliable tools on my sets. I'll be returning my Xt-3 and hopefully will hear back from Fujifilm to update this review."

Right out of the box after turning on the camera and confirming the date, the camera just freezes with black screen, and doesn't even responds to the turn off and on button, i have to physically remove the battery for it to turn off. i researched the problem online and i found a lot of people having the same issue and they called Fuji and they told them it's a fried motherboard!? Very disappointed in Fuji quality control. I was so looking forward to use it and i also bought 2 prime lenses for it, so i had to return everything. I guess after they moved their manufacturing from japan to china the quality went down hill.

I used this camera on a three month trip to Australia and New Zealand earlier this year with several Fuji prime lenses. It does everything you could ever need and the weather resistant housing is a major benefit.

My main gripe with this camera is that now that my work is done, I had planned to sell the camera here on Amazon but Fuji has placed restrictions on Amazon to prevent people from selling it. This is not an inexpensive camera which is now sitting on a shelf depreciating.

So buyer be ware - Fuji has some seriously terrible things they do to customers behind the scenes."

No complaints at all. I am writing this after using it for a year... Completed 1 year in May. Its good even if you are a beginner as you then will have more room to learn and can use all its features properly once you learn about them.

It's quite feature packed and equally compact and pretty easy to travel with. The 12-60 lens that I got with it is pretty good too and I found it useful for my projects like using it for vlog videos, short films, product films, some photography.
Although I am not a professional photographer. So do your research on the lens and the type that would suit yoilur need.

Battery life is ok I would say, It's not bad but not so good at all. I will recommend still keep an extra battery.

People talk about its auto focus not being so good, I honestly haven't used it much and always used manual focus... It dint have issues focusing whenever I did use it but that is something I can't comment about.

I have no complaints about it yet. Quite happy with it."

This is my own experience with using my new camera as compared to my previous and existing gear. I think it is unfair to rate it one star because of panning issues in video, besides a firmware update has already been released. I skipped the kit lens and got the Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8 instead. I did not encounter any such problems for this lens when IBIS or dual IS is on after the firmware update. My review is more on using this camera for stills.

Primary reasons why I bought the G85:

Lightweight and small, low profile, reasonable price of camera and lenses, good in lowlight conditions (with Dual IS), built-in bright EVF and LCD screen, versatile stills and video camera, customizable and easy user interface for a small mirrorless, weather sealed (water and dust resistant).

Camera features I really like:

• 4K Photo
• Silent mode
• Time-lapse option on the dial
• 11 customizable function butttons
• Customizable in-camera highlight and shadow. Cuts down work in post processing.
• Post focus and built-in Focus Stacking (JPEG only). I would prefer Focus Stacking output as RAW. However, with the highlight shadow feature setting I can pull up highlights and shadows in-camera and the JPEG result is still good. Hopefully RAW output will be included in the future.

Compared with the Sony a6000 (that I sold):

Focusing - The hybrid (w/ phase detect) autofocus with the a6000 is just phenomenal (now more impressive with the new a6500) but I don't shoot sports often. Contrast detect for the G85 is sufficient to track pets, kids, indoor sports (I prefer using the Panasonic 35-100mm f2.8). It can also track faster movement like birds in flight quite well. Short buffer on the a6000 compared to the G85.

Battery- Battery life is almost the same. Non-OEM batteries (Wasabi) used with the a6000 causes the camera to freeze. I had no problems with Wasabi batteries on the G85. Mirrorless cameras are notorious for sucking a lot of juice from your battery therefore you need to have at least two spare ones.

Powering On - Instantaneous on the G85. I can take pictures soon as I turn on the switch. Similar to my FF DSLR. With the a6000 it takes 2 to 3 secs to start up. Good luck if you use cheap batteries. I missed a lot of shots because of it.

Video - Of course, the G85 has an advantage with 4K does heats up quickly and so far after using it a couple or more times, it does not overheat. Sony a6000 starts heating up after taking video for more than 15 mins. It still plagues the a6300 and hopefully not the a6500. Diagonal panning issues and jitters have been resolved after the firmware update. Humming sound of the IBIS is still present with the G85. The humming can be picked up by the built in mic in a quiet environment. You need an external mic if you do need to record video in such conditions.

User interface - Love the DSLR like controls on the G85. Two dials (front and back) is very convenient in manual mode. Sony a6000 does not have intuitive controls like the G85. The G85 has 11 customizable function buttons (6 physical, 5 on the LCD screen), pressing a function button (physical) for 2 sec. will let you directly assign a function, not to mention the Q. MENU possibilities. What I like about this camera is that I can retain back button focusing when in PASM modes, and half pressed shutter focusing in auto mode which is not possible with my DSLR. The touchscreen and touch focusing feature with G85 is convenient and very responsive. Careful not to touch your nose on the screen though as it can move your focus point. Among some settings that are easily accessible when pressing the Exposure Compensation button (F1 by default) are Exposure Bracketing and Flash Compensation. Still looking for other cool stuff that this camera has in store.

IBIS and Dual IS - With Dual IS I can shoot even at 1/10th of sec. to even 1 sec. handheld and still get sharp images especially when paired with the 12-35mm f2.8 lens. The a6500 will have IBIS and dual IS on Sony lenses that has OSS.

Lenses - Reasonable prices for micro 4/3 lenses and other choices from Olympus, Rokinon or Sigma. Sony aps-c has limited zoom lenses and they are larger than micro 4/3. No Sony 24-70 f2.8 (35mm equivalent) for aps-c. Best I ever used is the Zeiss 16-70mm f4.0. Sony FF e-mount lenses are expensive. Main reason why I left Sony. If they have more lenses for aps-c and make it smaller and affordable, I may come back... maybe.

Image Quality - Love the IQ of photos taken with the a6000 but the IQ of the G85 is equally good despite having a smaller sensor. Just do not crop too much.

WiFi and Mobile App - The best I have ever used so far. It never prematurely disconnects, very capable controls and app performance is nearly flawless. Good job software team. The only caveat, as with all the other camera brand apps is that they only download images in JPEG. I only shoot in RAW and download my images to my iPad Pro using a card reader since I mostly edit my photos with Adobe Lightroom Mobile and later syncing and tweaking some of it on my PC. This is how rate my experience with the WiFi apps:
Very Good - Panasonic App w/ G85, Could have been Excellent if it downloads RAW.
Good - Sony PlayMemories w/ Sony a6000. Good controls but it disconnects. WiFi turned on quickly drains the battery.
Acceptable - Canon Camera Connect w/ Canon G7X Mark II (sold)
Mediocre - Nikon WMU w/ my D610 w/ wifi adapter, D5500 (sold). Limited controls and disconnects. Since I am an Apple user I cannot attest to how SnapBridge performs but still the app should work well with all platforms. As if Nikons software department is almost non-existent.

Why did I choose the G85 over the 1 inch sensor Canon G7X Mark II(sold)?
The G7X Mark II is an excellent camera because of its portability and performance in low light, but sometimes I needed a viewfinder. It is difficult to see anything on the LCD screen on a sunny day. Could not wait for the Nikon DL 18-50mm. Still no built in viewfinder and is priced at almost $1000. Sony RX 100 IV or V? Maybe. But soon as I got hold of this camera I just couldn't let go.

Why did I choose the G85 over the Sony a6500?
Price. The a6500 is $1500 . If I was thinking of getting the GH5, which is in the same price point, I would consider the a6500. However, native Sony aps-c E-mount lens selection is still limited.

Compared to my Nikon D610:

Image Quality - Full frame wins in this department, hands down. But if you only post photos in social media or don't print that often in large sizes then why need a full frame DSLR at all.

Weight and portability - I would rather equally enjoy taking photos and traveling without lugging heavy equipment. I would not drag my Nikon 80-200 f2.8D on overseas trips and would rather carry a Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 lens or Lumix 45-150mm lens. For most of my travels, I will just bring my Nikon 20mm f1.8G on my Nikon D610 for landscapes and Panasonic Lumix G85 cam and lenses (12-35mm f2.8, 35-100 f2.8 or the lighter and affordable 45-150mm f4.0-5.6) for walk-around.

Price - Micro 4/3 wins, camera and lenses! The pro grade Panasonic Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 lens with IS for the G85 is selling for $897 at this time of writing vs the expensive Nikon 70-200 f2.8G VRII for $2200+.

User Interface - Going from AF-S to AF-C on the D610 is a nuisance sometimes. Back button focusing resolves this issue and having it permanently on AF-C. Most DSLR users know this. The G85 however has a dedicated switch for AFS, AFC and MF. Awesome. I can take advantage of the 9 fps on AF-S or MF with focus peaking at any time. D610 has no wifi and touchscreen.

Build quality - My D610 looks and feels sturdier, however as light as it is, the build quality of the Panasonic G85 does not dissappoint.

Suffice to say, I am happy with my new camera system. I am a Micro 4/3 convert.

UPDATE: Purchased the Lumix 45-150mm, 35-100mm f2.8 and included sample photos. Night and long exposure shots of Union Square shot using Lumix 12-35 f2.8. Close up of xmas tree and skating rink shot at 1/15th, f2.8, ISO 800 handheld. Bird photos using the Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 at 100mm.

UPDATE 2: In video mode, microjitters are still apparent when using the long end of the Lumix 35-100mm f2.8, even after the firmware update. You may not want to shoot handheld at 100mm. No problems with the Lumix 12-35mm f2.8 which normally what I use for video anyway. Still a stellar performer."

Great all-round camera.",2018-01-27,"Best video camera for under $1,000
You can't go wrong with this one, it's a great all-rounder. Super video, very good still pictures. good ergonomics.
I bought one of these when one of my G7 cams conked out. I needed it on the same day so I didn't get a great deal, but it was not so bad, price wise. It's like a G7 plus.
It's a little heavier, a little better built, has better weather seals, and more features. All the great dials of the G7 but everything is more solid. When you first pick it up, and look at it, you think ""G7"". But then when you pick them up side by side, you can feel that it is just a bit more solid and a tiny bit thicker, and there's some really small changes to the layout.

IQ is about the same as the GX85, ever so slightly better than the G7. It's a teeny teeny bit less sharp than the GH5.

Someone obviously thought a lot about the controls and ergonomics, for example, there's a little indent so you can flip out the screen easier. However, as some have noted, the buttons on the back are hard to feel and have a very short travel. Not a deal breaker but it is nice to be able to navigate by touch easily.
Similarly, the mode dial is just a bit more solid, in keeping with the overall ""more solid"" style of the camera.
Weight: with a battery, and with a card, but no lens or cap, 506 grams. The G7 weighs 413 grams. I weighed all three G7 cams and they weighed the same, the silver weighs the same as the black, just in case you are curious. So 93 grams, not a lot, but not a little.

Image stabilization works great. Floats like a good bar of soap. Not like 5 stops but really nice and smooth.

Shutter is nice and quiet. So, I personally think there may still be some shutter shock, but it is really smooth compared to other Panasonic cameras and a very nice piece of high tech in the new shutter.

Viewfinder: it's great. Big, bright viewfinder. Now, the GX85 had a more ""movie"" style viewfinder, but it is also off center. The G85 has it right in the center, but in a more photo like crop format. Manual focus with peaking through the VF is pretty awesome.

There's one thing I didn't read anywhere, maybe I missed it, there's a setting that tells the camera to reset the lens to where it was when you turned it off, when you turn it back on. Now this is a totally great feature.

Focus was pretty zippy. Takes the same battery as the G7 (I still have the battery from my GH2).
One pain--if you are using a dummy battery, there is a stupid hole in the bottom so you have to disconnect the battery from the battery or power supply and thread it through the hole, You can't just pop it in.

On thing that is better on the GX85 is that you can use the built in flash as a bounce flash. It's very cool. Sadly, this is not so on the G85. I rarely use it, but every now and then it is great to have the built in bounce flash.

Several reviews have said that the G85 writes video files just like the G7, that is, when it gets to 4GB it seamlessly starts a new file. Actually, that is not true. I'm guessing they never tried it. If you record a video in 4K, it writes one big file just like the GX85, which is what you would expect since the electronics are similar.

Other reviewers note that you can take a non IS lens, like the Olly 75mm, or a legacy lens, and shoot at .4 seconds aperture handheld, using the cameras in body stabilization. Well, I tried that and I think like all of this vaporware about IS you have to be realistic. I was able to consistently get a sharp image at 1/15 second and sometimes 1/10 with the heavy 75mm.

Although the specs list 4K as 24p, it is in fact 23.976 fps. I mention this because several Panasonic cameras do shoot at real 24p (like the GH5), and Panasonic should clear up their terminology, and the review sites just cut and paste it, of course.

Noise and whir: this camera has gyroscopes to help with the IS. If you hold your ear up to the camera, you will hear a soft whir. If you place a mic right on it, you might pick up some whir. It makes the exact type of whir that an image stabilized lens does. And, if you have the two together, you will get a bit more of this sound. You can't hear it two feet away, but for super sensitive recordings, factor that in. The GX85 makes the same noise, as does any camcorder with IS.

Overall, it feels like the best of the G7 and the GX85, with better stabilization and a nice set of features. No time limit on mine. It does make one appreciate the lightness of the G7, actually, but there are times when you want a more rugged camera, for sure.

So for travel, you have to ""weigh"" the additional features against the heavier weight and a few mm more bulk. I like having IS on the camera, and with the 14-42 kit you get the double IS.

It's a nice camera, bottom line."

Scully,"Incredible Value, IF You Can Settle For Less Than Cutting Edge",2022-08-06,"In this day of camera smart-phones, is there still a place for DSLRs?

I say yes, if you actually want to take pictures rather than snapshots and if you are willing spend some money and are ready to haul some stuff around to take those pictures. I settled on the Micro 4/3 format because it is the most easily portable DSLR camera, and therefore the most likely to be used by me. I don't see myself printing larger than 8x10 photos so 16mp is more than enough and overkill for social media. The regular-speed 4K video is more than adequate for and videography I will be doing (invest in a good mike to up your game).

A HUGE plus is the fact that this camera and kit lens that cam with it are weather-sealed so I have peace of mind taking it on a hike.

I look forward for using 4K pre-burst mode, it is literally a time machine, letting you capture an event up to one second before you push the shutter button! It allows you to follow your child on the field and to get the shots you really want with having to take thousands of pictures.

There are trade-offs for not going full-frame sensor (e.g. low-light performance, less depth of field) but the price differential, $697 on sale with a 12-60mm weather proof lens, rather than thousands for the bigger camera? It was a no brainer for me.

Great ergonomics, custom setting modes that can be saved to allow up to 4 different set-ups, a very good and versatile kit lens (24-120mm 35mm equivalent focal length) all in a camera that I will take on day hikes.

Go on Youtube and watch some videos about what this camera can do. You will see that it is still more than adequate for a hobby-enthusiast. It has rekindled my love of photography. Happy snapping!"

In most respects it's a step up. I primarily needed a camera with better video. The D3300 was and still is an outstanding entry level DSLR for still photography, but it's very underwhelming for video, which what I find myself doing more off these days. The video autofocus on the D3300 is borderline unusable, it hunts relentlessly. When picking out a new camera. I was looking at the Cannon 80D (no 4k video), the 90D (very nice, but comparatively expensive), the Nikon Z50 (very good AF, but the lack of lens selection and the cost of the available lenses at the time of purchase scared me off), the G9 (pretty much everything I wanted , but more than I wanted to spend), and the G95 (killer V.log profile, but otherwise not much improvement over the G85.

I went with the G85 since it was a proven commodity, and had widely available and affordable lenses. For still photography I think the lower MP sensor hurts it vs. the big sensor APS-C cameras, but it's still acceptable. The autofocus is quick, even when doing bursts. For video , which why I got it, it's impressive. Autofocus is very good, about on par with the Canons at 1080p and okay at 4k, ,the stabilization with both the OEM lenses and body is very nice. Build quality is above average for the price bracket. The wifi works very well too. The only negatives are that battery life isn't amazing, and there's no headphone jack (there is a mic jack). I feel like the G85 is a very good value for money. You're getting a lot camera for your dollar. The G9 is nicer in every way, but cost a few hundred more. The G95 is also somewhat more expensive, but I don't think you're getting much in return for the extra money spent.

The G85 isn't perfect, if you want a camera primarily for still photography. I'd stick with a comparable APS-C DSLR for the same or less money. The 80D and D7500 are going to be superior to the G85 for that. But for video the G85 is hard to beat for the price."

I want to shoot and then minimize editing as much as possible so that's why I like the G85 so much. The 4k video quality with standard un-graded settings is better than the GH4 I replaced this with. The clarity and color is better with the standard settings and I don't really have time to get lost in post processing. I also compared this to the Sony RX10iii and its 4k video quality was just a tiny bit less detailed but the overall look was better with the G85. Also the menu settings are so much easier with the g85 over the Sony. Also the button placement is much more intuitive with the G85. Auto focus seems about the same but I mainly use manual for video to make sure it stays in focus. Especially because I'm shooting in a controlled environment. I'll miss the wide focus range but not by that much and I can always buy more lenses with the G85. Another thing is the G85 seems like it has a touch less crop shooting in 4k so I can get a slightly larger angle. That bothers me with all cameras when shooting 4k and I wish I could get the 35mm equivalent of 24mm out of it instead of more like 28mm in 4k. Also it seems that the Pictures were much better with the G85. It seems that whenever I put the RX10iii in auto focus to try to get some kid pics for fun 1 out of 5 pics came out correctly where almost every pic comes out correctly with the G85. For me the f3.5 does a good job but it sure does look better with the f2.8 12-35 lens. I thought my untrained eye might not pick that up but it did. Everything looks better even when comparing f3.5 vs. f3.5. It's pricey so it might not be for everyone. I also tried the Sony a6300 and it was an amazing camera but it overheated very quickly weather I pulled the monitor away from the body or not. So there was no way I could keep it and that's a major deal breaker. The G85 can get warm but never get's so hot that it over heats and shuts down when shooting for extended periods in 4k. I shot for about 4-5 hours in a row shootiing 5-8 minute vids at a quick turn around and it never shut down. It got a little warmer than the GH4 and Sony RX10iii but never malfunctioned so all is well.

The one issue I have with the G85 is I wish there was a 4k 30mbps instead of just 4k 100mbps. I shot around 40 5-8 minute videos and it was something like 122Gb. I had to use compression software to keep it which is a bit anoyying. Love the water/dust resistance and that is what kept me from keeping the G7. It also feels like a better made camera than the G7 with a more intuitive layout too.

If you are like me, an intermediate, who needs a good camera with 4k for work but doesn't want to go too deep into the post processing world it's hard to find a better camera."

I wanted a camera that's good for photography and video, and the G85 has lived up to my expectations. Not only is the camera good, but I also like the well developed ecosystem of lenses and accessories, which continues to grow and improve.

Likes:
* The controls are intuitive and responsive, with many switches and buttons to quickly access the setting I need, and there's a lot of ways to customize the controls to my preference. The touch screen further augments the physical controls, and I use it often. I also like the two custom modes on the dial to quickly access my often used settings.
* The ergonomics and hand comfort are good. Controls can be reached without straining my fingers. I can carry the camera and kit lens without a strap, and not feel any noticeable discomfort.
* It can reliably and quickly focus under low light and tricky conditions. Better than my old DSLR.
* The image stabilization is outstanding. It allows for almost effortless hand holding at normal focal lengths, and reasonably feasible hand holding at 300mm and longer focal lengths.
* The image quality is very good, better than my old DSLR in terms of dynamic range, sharpness, noise performance. Since I don't plan on using crazy high ISO, I don't need a larger sensor, and the compromises of an inferior system.
* Did I mention the system? Not only is this camera weather sealed, but Panasonic has a growing number of weather sealed lenses to match. One of the reasons why I didn't go with the Sony E-mount system. I'm also enjoying the benefits of a 600mm-equivalent tele lens that isn't ridiculously bulky and heavy.
* It actually has a built in flash. Since I don't plan on limiting my self to an indoor studio, and don't plan to lug around a bulky external flash, this was a must have feature for me. If Fuji would have thought of such a revolutionary idea, maybe I would be using their camera instead.
* It has the video features I need - external mic jack, tilt and swivel screen, peaking, zebra stripes, and manual exposure. Many other mirrorless cameras I looked at were missing one or more of these.
* Panasonic has addressed the early problems of stabilization humming and jerky panning with firmware upgrades. I no longer have any serious complaints about the camera, and it shows they take their camera business seriously.
* The kit lens is noticeably more capable than most other kit lenses elsewhere. Not only is the zoom range wider and longer, but it's weather sealed to match the camera body. This is the lens I use most often.

Dislikes:
* It would have been nice to incorporate a wireless remote shutter release that doesn't involve a smartphone, like the inexpensive infrared remote on my Nikon D40. Instead I'm forced to buy a more expensive and less convenient cable release.

Overall, a very capable camera and system, and priced lower than the competition I looked at. Looking forward to getting a lot of use from this new camera."

J. Hawkins,Reasonably priced Micro 4/3s Progress,2016-11-14,"I have been thinking of buying the OMD EM1 Mark 2. I am an enthusiast and take pictures of my family and for travel. Many years ago, I sold my Canon bodies/lenses to get into Micro 4/3’s. Like many, my investment in film lenses led me to Canon bodies in the electronic world. However, it became clear to me that the electronic world offered new opportunities as the technology improved. It looked like Micro 4/3 sensors would be the sweet spot for most photography in this new world. My first 4/3’s camera was a Panasonic. I loved it.

Later I upgraded to the OMD EM5 Mark 2 for the better-quality sensor, better in-body stabilization system, and small size. The technology was advancing.

Update: I have used the camera for some time now. There have been two firmware updates to improve stabilization and stabilization ""hum"" and I am using the Panasonic 100-400 with dual IS. I cannot say enough about how good this camera is, and at the price, it is a great value. I have added some pictures using the zoom lens and 12-60 lens for illustration.

Time passed, looking for my next upgrade. It is not picture quality driving me, but 4K video and, frankly handling. Don’t like the size of the existing OMD camera for handling. Just a bit too small physically.

Out comes the OMD EM1 Mark 2 for body only almost $2,000, but looks like better handling. Very professional features, especially fast focus and rapid fire. Also, higher pixel stills is interesting technology. But What. $2,000.

I found the G85. I bought it despite the stability issue. I do not have a noise issue in video. Price is right. I am using it and it meets my needs. (I expect a firmware update, but camera is entirely usable for photography, which is my focus, pun intended. I have also made some video’s and they are passable. There is a little “jump” at the start of the pan, but for me, I could survive. I expect that Panasonic will fix this, as the GX85 does not exhibit this behavior.)

Handling is much better with a larger size handle for holding and taking pictures. Still light and better than dslr’s for everyday picture taking. This is the next generation of Micro 4/3’s. Frankly, I like the on-off switches on the right side, and this does it. (You can set up the dual switch on EM2 2 to be the on-off switch but too expensive to buy just for this.)

Picture quality is superb. Not the reason to upgrade or switch brands.

I had forgotten, but I much prefer the Panasonic UI to the Olympus. I much prefer the Panasonic smartphone apps, in addition.

Micro 4/3’s is really where the action is, as there is strong and vibrant competition. I wish all markets were like this. I expect features to improve and prices to fall."

Highly recommend to all!,2017-01-09,"One of the best value camera out there. Hands down.
For current users, I highly suggest to do the following: Go to menu --> Setup --> beep (page 2) --> Turn off the beep volume and E shutter volume
This was a huge annoyance for me at first, and I was relieved to find it in the settings.
Battery saving options are also within the page 2 of setup such as Live View Mode (30fps), Monitor Luminance, and Economy.

Pros:
Stills quality is very nice and sharp, even from the 12-60mm kit lens. Image quality and bokeh are stunning when paired with the 25mm f1.7. The dual IS is really good for stills and even more amazing in video. Two custom settings within the dial are really helpful for saving your own shooting modes. I personally save Shutter-priority video moves to these in different recording formats (i.e. 4k30fps, FHD60fps). There are also plenty of fn buttons to customize. There are also color profiles to shoot in that may be customized. I find that the ""Natural"" profile to be the most pleasing in video. There is also Cine-D for those wanting a flatter look or for grading.
Weather sealed - Not much to say here other than, great!
Coming from a Nikon APSC camera, I am amazed at how light and robust the mirrorless form factor is. There is little fatigue in carrying it in your hands all day. The LCD screen that allows a full swivel is really neat for selfies/vlogging.
Finally... the video. Most buyers are probably here b/c of this and yes... it does not disappoint. The detail is amazing! BUT, the real shocker is the image stabilization. When paired w/ dual IS and E-stabilization turned on, the video is practically gliding (especially @ wider angles - 12mm). I am not joking. Walking with the camera is buttery smooth, no jittery videos.

Cons:
It's only up to 16MP stills, though I still find the image quality to be very good even when an image has been cropped in edits.
I found that the image is a bit noisy at higher iso (6400 and above), though this is not really a bother to me. I find that it gives it a natural feel to lowlight shots. You can always dial it down with a bit of NR in Lightroom and other software.
A slight crop to the 4k video recording.
This was not a con for me, but others may think it. There's a lot to learn w/in the settings of this camera. Take the time to read the advanced handbook. Experiment!

In summary, I highly recommend this. If you are on the fence, JUMP OVER!"

But, for video - battery life sucks, stabilization - sucks, good lenses are expensive and few options. no mic input. no flip out screen and no live view app support in video (only A6300/6500), it overheats in video very often and oh - did I mention battery life sucks?
For travel, family etc. - for causal family and travel stuff - it's amazing, but for youtube reviews, vloging etc. - it's really not. the a6500 is good alternative but still has many of the above flaws.
So after months of research i've ordered the G85, as it was the best option with - good price, flip out screen, good IS, nice kit lens, mic input, touch screen, battery life...and many reviewers and youtubers recommended it.
After using it for 1-2 months - I'm anxiously waiting for the next model from sony that will hopefully have mic input and flip out screen.
The G85 has a lot of good things going for it, and I knew it's flaws before buying, but after usuing it just doesn't feel like it's really worth the price.
Picture and video quality - is just ok. it's noticeably worse than the APC-C Sony and nosier in lower light (as expected). Sure it can take nice photos and AF is fairly quick, but it's not 1000$ level kind of quality you expect.
For video, the main reason I bought it for, it's ok. having a mic input and flip out screen - is a HUGE bonus. if you have a sony a6300/6500
AF - well, at first you think, oh it's not so bad, I can work with this, or maybe just manual focus, but then you watch on your pc and see it's just crap half the time, even when you set up the scene and settings to it's favor.
IS - sometimes it's great, sometimes and swings right and left like i'm on a boat (i'm not).
Battery life - much better than the A6000, but just about everything is. objectively - it's just average.
Menu system, buttons etc - so many reviews bash the sony and rave the lumix, but I can't relate. using the screen is nice for sure, but nothing is very intuitive or simple here. I've learned the sony, cannon and others much quicker, while on this one i'm still fumbling with the most basic settings almost every time I turn it on.
Weather proofing - meh. just flimsy plasticy caps on the ports. will think twice before using it in the rain.
mic jack - smack in the middle of the flip out screen - so annoying!
native 4:3 sensor ratio - I prefer the 16:10/16:9 ratio a lot more. especially video.
I ordered the 25MM f1.7 and hopefully it will help.
So overall, for stills - there are much better options in my opinion.
For video - it's definitely a step up from a sony a6000 and can get great results. but i'm not too impressed. Looking back i'd probably should have picked the cannon SL2 (great af, lenes, flipout screen) or the sony A6500 (and use my sony lenses and phone apps as flip out screen).
Panasonic should really step up their AF game."

Among the several Panasonic bodies I've owned, my favorite had become the G7 (the predecessor to the G85) for its light weight, compactness, handling and grip, the many controls and their placement, and its customization options available. With some feature-upgrades (added IBIS, improved EVF, a metal front-plate, better mechanical shutter [although I generally use the electronic shutters in my cameras, since they are quiet and shake-free], etc.), and with an interesting lens included, I bought a G85 with the 12-60mm lens as a kit. Upon receipt, I checked for an early stabilization defect some people had noted with video - but my sample did not appear to have this problem (it's since been addressed with a firmware update for early G85 samples).

I soon returned the kit for a refund for two reasons: with the G85, a very light G7 had become almost as heavy as my GH4 (which I recently sold, since I no longer shot much video with it, and I preferred the much lighter G7 for stills); and this second sample of the 12-60mm lens, which was much improved over the first sample of this lens that I tried, it was still not up to the image-quality of alternative lenses that I already owned - and it still had some evident asymmetrical image-softness problems.

I've taken about 200,000 photographs in the last few years with this MFT gear, and I prefer light and compact cameras and lenses for most of what I do with it - and as a result, the very noticeably increased weight of the G85 was an issue for me that overwhelmed its functional advantages over the G7. The G85 is a very nice camera, with many excellent features - but it was not a good replacement for my G7s for me...

I contacted Panasonic and they want me to pay to ship it to a third party company, after looking up this third party repair center it's not looking good. VERY few reviews of them and the ones that do exist are extremely negative, I'm hesitant to send my camera to them but it's my only option. I'll update this again if nothing goes wrong.

Update on Repair: Camera was out for two months with no ETA on the replacement part, neither Panasonic nor the third party repair company that was actually doing the service were keeping in touch and were both extremely unhelpful. I requested the camera back whether they could repair it or not since I needed it for Christmas, they offered to use the grip off of a demo unit that had never actually been used so I said yes. The camera came back and the rubber on the grip is definitely more secure, but is clearly still lifting off the body slightly in some spots. Unacceptable build quality and service on my unit for a $1000 body. Stick to Canon or Nikon for stills and if you REALLY need video (but don't need the ""rugged"" build or extra features) get a Panasonic G7 of go higher end to the GH4 or GH5/G9 instead.

Video quality and amount of features are amazing for the price, stills quality is good too with high quality lenses generally being less expensive than on APS-C or Full Frame cameras. High ISO performance is nowhere near as good as APC or Full Frame sensors but in good light you should have no issues with image quality. I've gotten amazing looking shots at 10,000+ ISO, I wouldn't print them but they still look fine for sharing online. Still an amazing camera given the price, they give you a $500 weather sealed lens as the kit lens for an extra $100. If you want faster autofocus, especially continuous autofocus, you'll wanna stick with Panasonic lenses as that will let you use their DFD technology. If you use Olympus lenses you will lose this feature but if you're mainly using single focus and are a more experienced shooter that will be switching focus modes when needed then you should be fine."

All stills were shot on the kit lens that comes with the camera. @stillsbygom on Instagram for more.

Because I don’t want this review to be too long I’m going to get straight to what you would need to know about.

Pros:
In body stabilization
Small form factor
Lens adaptability
Hybrid shooting style
4K video @ 30-24fps ( REALLY good for entry level video)
Custom picture profiles (Cinelike D)
Easy to navigate menu set up
*Price*
Modern minimalistic feel and design
Infinite recording

Cons

Poor lowlight (Easily fixed with speed booster)
Manageable autofocus but not so great in most situations.
Native lenses and accessories are bloody expensive
Focus peaking isn’t so great. It does the job but you’re better off focusing on you’re own
Digital viewfinder isn’t too great
Botton layout is too compact (Justified by it’s small form factor but I have to find SOMETHING wrong lol)
Transferring stills to your smartphone is useless via WiFi. Just buy a $20 SD card reader.

Overall:
This camera is a really good budget option for beginners and consumers. I recommend getting the sigma 16mm 1.4 M 4/3 , Panasonic 12-60 2.8 and sigma 35mm 1.4 M4/3 to cover all of your shooting needs.
If you are looking into paid work and need high quality sharp images I recommend the sigma 18-35mm Canon EF paired with a viltrox speedbooster and a Tamron 45mm 1.8 Canon EF."

With that in mind, this camera has done an exceptional job at filling a spot I didn't know I needed to address! I love being able to have a camera that I can take on trips- it's weatherproofed and ruggedized body inspires lots of confidence, even if people are bumping into you. I also feel like it's a ""cheap enough looking"" camera, that people won't take notice like if you're traveling with a full frame DSLR/SLR.
Pros:
Takes unbelievably good quality photos - Even though it's a 16MP sensor- don't trust the haters, research for yourself that more MP is not always better
Great kit lens- nice quality glass for what it is
Stellar 4k footage w/ microphone hot shoe and 180 degree screen swivel makes Vlogging and recording 4k an absolute treat!
Rugged and Weatherproof- Great option for those who don't stop shooting once it starts raining or snowing

Cons:
Not the best Autofocus in the industry
UI is a little weird, just takes a little bit to get used to it

Overall I've been really pleased with this camera. It's now become my Go-To travel option when I'm scouting photos.

Needless to say -very odd phrase- I still have them and have used on several video and still shoots.
Results have been more than satisfactory, this coming from a 40 year plus professional photographer/film maker. Digital has come along way from our first (digital ) camera Nikon D1.
Quality of image both video and still is excellent.
Ease of use - if you have an ability to learn things like one plus one is actually two... you'll work out how to best set up these cameras for your own prefernces. There are a lot of videos that can help but use as guides not as absolutes.
There are slew of accessories to further enhance your shooting needs.
Given everything above there is one thing I miss and that is the zoom control. Surmountable with attachments/in post but still would be nice to have.
One more very important thing the color balance between two cameras of the same make/model is often not, the two G85s I have, need very little adjustments in post to balance.
Oh and they weigh almost nothing so shooting hand held for hours is a breeze!
Would I buy again? Absolutely!

Know your settings and you won't have troubles event with autofocus.,2020-10-18,"Video features are OK for most of my uses, and are quite advanced for a camera that is now a bit ""old"" (several models from all brands have come out to the market since this one was realeased). HD and 4K recording is perfectly fine up to 60fps I believe. HD in particular is very natural looking, in my opinion. It has more customization that I think I'd ever use, and menus and controls are perfectly well laid out. I am writing this because even though today's camera's pack more features, this one would be perfecly well for a bunch of users. IBIS looks natural to me, and I don't need more (if you're handholding the camera and walking across the fields you'll show in your video that you're doing so, but it is fine in my opinion). I know continuous autofocus is not ideal, but if you understand the settings you need to be on while doing your stuff you'll have very little problems with it. For vlogging, with the camera more or less at a constand distance from hy head I don't have issues."

Johns,Extremely versatile digital camera,2021-02-18,"When I transitioned from film to digital photography, I really only considered Pentax cameras, since my film cameras were all from Pentax and their common lens mounts meant that I wouldn't need to re-invest in lots of new lenses. I purchased a Pentax *ist-DS DSLR camera, and for more than a decade that was my work horse camera. However, I began to notice that I was becoming frustrated with the limitations of the camera, and started thinking about a replacement.

I was visiting a friend in Southern California and he showed me his camera. As a cinematographer, I know that he knows cameras, and he was using this camera as his personal camera. After seeing him demonstrate some of its capabilities, I began to look at the Lumix cameras and their competitors. I was impressed by the ability of these mirrorless cameras to apply digital filters to the viewfinder images, so that the user can see how the shot will look before pressing the shutter release and capturing the image. After some reading, I ended up picking the same Lumix that my friend uses. It is probably more camera than I need, but I figured that it would be good to have a camera with more capability than I currently need, as it would give me room to grow as a photographer.

Having used this camera for a while now, I must say that my favorite features are its image stabilization and low light capabilities. I've managed to produce surprisingly good hand held shots in low light situations that would absolutely required a tripod with my Pentax SDLR. I also like the MPEG burst mode when I'm shooting action, which allows me to capture short bursts of video of the action and then extract the perfect moment from the clip as a JPEG image. It makes it so much easier to capture the perfect moment in an action sequence.

There are far too many filters to describe here. But they are all easy to use, and the camera can be set to save both the filtered and unfiltered shot, so that you can also use filters in other software to play with the original scene.

There is so much to like about this camera - it is both smaller and lighter than my previous SDLR, and it has allowed me to produce better photos. I have no regrets about this choice."

The controls feel solid and the grip works for single hand shooting as I hold flash on a cable off to the side; I have big hands. I shoot aperture preferred and that works well. The 12-60 standard lens is quite sharp, better than what I get with Canon FD lenses of 1972 that I adapted onto the G85. Startup and autofocus are plenty fast. Adobe Photoshop Essentials 14 doesn’t open the raw files of the G85 but Adobe DNG (free download) does do a fine job of opening the raw files of G85 for PE14. The range of controls available on G85 is so great, but I got good images early on using default settings. Build quality is superior. The ability to adjust exposure when shooting that is so close to the final desired result is what stuns me. That allows me to make the most out of the info from the sensor. The compact size and modest weight are much appreciated too. My images are mostly for display on iPad and 5x7 prints but I bet larger prints would be fine too.

The G85 gains some notable upgrades, particularly regarding the camera body and 4K video, yet without abandoning the mid-range price point of its predecessor. I was very impressed by its overall performance and capabilities during my real-world testing. This feature-rich mirrorless camera packs a punch for both still and video shooters, alike.

PROS
Very good image quality; Very good high ISO performance and dynamic range; Fast and accurate autofocus; Excellent 4K video recording quality and features.

CONS
OLPF-less sensor is prone to moiré; Electronic viewfinder struggles in low light; Continuous autofocus is nowhere near as good as Sony or Canon's, but depending on what lens you use with it to it can have a okay autofocus performance; Below average battery life."

This is a great camera that comes in at a phenomenal value. The kit lens accompanying the Lumix G85, 12-60mm, is surprising in itself; it's both sharp and wide considering it is a prepackaged lens. Although I have many lenses I will be using this one along with my others.
With the positive feedback on the exposure compensation it's far easier to get great low-light video with little noise despite what you may have read.

Out of the box it produces quality photos and videos with a wide variety of composition and style. It only gets better with the addition of different lenses and other accessories so you will continue to break limits for a long time to come.

It's a flexible camera that serves it's purpose beautifully. If it's a main camera, backup, or B-roll the Lumix G85 will serve it's purpose well. I own several cameras that triples the G85 price, which are technically superior, and yet I still find myself using this one more often with even better results.

I originally purchased this camera as a trainer for my wife, but I quickly took it over and now I've had to buy her a new one. There is a good reason this camera has a strong cult following."

It was advertised as having it but I found out it did not and it depended on the lenses having it in order to use it. Well this severely limits your ability to purchase lenses from other manufacturers because of this fact. I sent it back and got the G85.

Almost immediately you can feel the difference. The G85 is heavier and feels more solid (has a magnesium front plate) and I also found out that it is weather sealed! This camera also has IBS and when it is coupled with a Lens with IS, you get dual IS!!!!

There is no Anti-Aliasing so your pics are always sharp. The G7 had no way to turn this feature off. The Lens that comes with it isn't bad at all and I actually took some nice landscapes with it.

Bottom line, this is a great camera and far superior to the G7. If you are thinking about getting a G7, just spend a little more and get the G85."

Probably what I like the most of this camera is how it feels, which is probably not a very technical assessment. However, that is just one of those little things that motivate you to take more photos.

The camera has so many options that it may be overwhelming at the beginning, but it is worth investing some time going over and over through the menu. I was already familiar with the menus because I have a ZS100 and, in fact, took me a while to get familiar with a set of characteristics that work well for me.

I had a little issue because pictures were showing a black spot when using the smallest aperture. However, I initiated an exchange with Amazon and I had another camera before I was ready to return the original one. Kudos to Amazon!

I recommend this camera, and buying it with Amazon for peace of mind.

Originally I struggled with switching systems, as I like the form factor of Fujis and the engine on the Sony's; I ultimately stuck with the M4/3 due to its size: I can fit two bodies, 5 lenses, and everything else I need in the Think Tank Trifecta 8 and go. The key features that made me go with this camera:

- Weatherproofing: the kit lens is weatherproof, as well as several other oly/pana lenses. Pop one on and get as close to that waterfall as you want.
- IBIS: couple this camera with one of the Voigtlanders wide open and you can shoot night photos no problem
- 4K photo mode: awesome for the kids, takes a one second clip in 4K and you can pull a still right out
- EVF: HUGE upgrade over the GX7, bright and beautiful
- Ergos: feels good in the hand and it's built tight - buttons have a firm reassuring feel to them
- Upgraded Shutter and AF

Only downsides to the camera are downsides to M4/3 in general: photos get noisy with high ISO and you can't rapid fire RAW photos at 12FPS. You can clean up the first in Lightroom and get by with 4K photos on the second.

Highly recommend"

I was highly disappointed with it. While the camera offers 4k footage, in-body image stabilization, a flip screen, a microphone port, and an easy to use touch screen, I had some use-specific gripes about it.

If you are filming yourself, this camera may seem perfect.

Issue # 1: The Autofocus
The AF system on this camera is contrast-based, and I lost several pieces of footage because the autofocus lost my face during filming. My vision is not the best, so I looked at the flip screen and it seemed like I was in focus. When I got home to edit the footage for my vlog, it was focused on the background, rather than my friend and I. This happened a few times. I think you could get focus for stills easily using the viewfinder, but you definitely cannot rely on the autofocus to film yourself. If you have someone helping you film, I don't think this will be an issue.

Issue # 2: Lens Prices & Crop Factor
I picked up this camera with the 14mm f2.5 lens to do my VLOGS. The lens quality was fine, but it just wasn't wide enough for what I needed. The crop factor on this camera is 2, so you must multiply the focal length and aperture by 2 to get the effective 35mm focal length and aperture. Therefore, my 14mm lens was actually a 28mm f5. A LOT of people don't understand this, which makes people think the cheaper lenses are much better than they actually are.

Anyway, so I looked into the lens selection of wider lenses. The best focal length on Panasonic cameras for vlogging is actually 12mm (24mm equivalent). The lens options were a wide angle zoom (for about $800 or more or the 12mm f/1.2 for $1,300. These lenses really are needed for vlogging yourself or shooting in situations where you don't have a lot of light or want to separate yourself from the background. The lenses are much more expensive for the Micro Four Thirds cameras (like this one) because they need a much more expensive array of lenses to get enough light onto the smaller sensor. Therefore, I would not recommend this camera for vlogging due to the expense of these lenses, the crop factor, and the low light performance (without an expensive lens).

Overall, I would recommend a different camera for someone who wants to vlog or does a lot of self filming. I think Sony's RX100 Mark V is much better for vlogging in 4k with a few caveats. The Canon G7x Mark II is also great is you don't think 4k is a must. As for 4k interchangeable lens cameras go, I think your money might be better spent on a Sony A600 or A6300 (roughly the same price as this one), because it will give you better image quality and autofocus you can count on. It doesn't have a flip screen like this one, but you will get a lot more footage you can use."

Here are a few points to know:
- stabilization is insanely good; practice just walking with it if in wide angle mode.
- custom settings are very important to learn and use well. Learn what they save and what they don't, and differences between photo and video modes. This is very important and I suggest you watch youtube to learn this. I personally use c1 for auto photo (and video), c2a for custom manual video, c2b for auto video 4k, c2c for timelapse settings. These may sound similar, but they are all very different and you should find what matches your needs. The timelapse setting for instance has a very different size ratio and uses jpgs while for everything else I use raw.
- kit lens is nice but you'll want something faster because low-light shooting is understandably bad on this small sensor.
- One thing that helps with bad low-light video is to shoot in 4k with -5 contrast and -5 in all other settings with noise reduction off. Expose as best you can. Then import it into your NLE or handbrake and create a prores 422 file with 1080 resolution. This reduces the noise significantly, and you can further reduce it in your editor. I add film grain too."

I've tested its 5 axis dual image stabilization and as others have already reported, stabilization and smoothing on side and diagonal movements are pretty s***ty.

I wasn't sure if that was the expected behaviour or not, but given that other camera's dual IS like GX85 is working fine for sideway movements, G85 should not have this issue.

Here is the video test footage I uploaded to my YouTube channel:
[...]
[...]

I will post more in-depth review of image stabilization feature.

For the record, Panasonic has announced/admitted that G85 has issues with dual I.S. So at least that's good to know (that means, IS for sideways and diagonal movements are to be improved).

Other than that, G85 was exactly what I wanted, and this is a pretty cool camera that has:
-4k video
-autofocus during video
-light
-IS
-180 degree flip screen
-external mic jack
-very sharp photo/video even if the 12-60m kit lens is used
-awesome features like 4K live cropping (panning and zooming) => my video using 4K live cropping ([...])
-solid gripping
-rugged metal body

I'm pretty satisfied with the kit lens as well (except low light situation). Will buy Leica 15mm F1.8 for extra blurriness and bokeh!"

I’ve heard of it happening to other people but never to me, until now. I new something was up when I opened the shipping box and the camera box looked kind of worn. I opened the camera box and noticed the camera strap was attached to the camera, the camera was not in any type of wrapping and the charger was loose. There were finger prints all over the rear display and after taking one photo I noticed the count was 533. Called Amazon and they apologized.... really what more could they say. I’m sending it back but I’ve been playing with it and so far so good. I’ve already have a GM5 and GM1 with several lenses and will probably end up selling one of the GM’s once I get a NEW G85."

The Panasonic G85 delivers enough still IQ, excellent ergonomics, and superb video quality that I haven't looked back.

The IBIS works amazingly well with both pictures and videos. The camera and lenses are light and small compared to FF and APSC cameras, increasing the odds of me actually carrying my camera around.

If you've been thinking about switching to the M43 systems, give the G85 a try. It has everything one would want for everyday use.

The only downside to this camera is the smallish 16mp sensor. While 16mp is more than most people will need, it was one of my reasons for not wanting to switch to M43 cameras. Having used it, it's not a big deal to me, but it might be to you.

Anyway, Amazon has a great return policy if you find the G85 isn't for you."

It's future proofed with good 4k capabilities. There are plenty of lenses to choose from on the market. The picture quality stands up to full size DSLRs in good light.
When shooting in low light situations, some would say the camera fails. But I'd say those photographers suck because all you need to do is open your aperture up to the widest, slow the shutter speed down to usable settings, and be as steady&smooth as possible; only using ISO when absolutely needed. I traveled across Australia with this thing and I got great shots everywhere; sunrises, sunsets, midday, dark rooms. The thing that blew me away about this camera is everyone is fawning over it's big brother, the GH5, but they fail to realize there's a $1000 price difference for little to any performance difference outside of 4k with 30fps vs GH5's 4k with 60fps."

After shooting around 8 hours of video and 120 GB of images...I have to say, I'm very very impressed. This is hands down the best camera I've ever owned. The features and quality for the price are unmatched. This is the only camera I've found that will endlessly record 4k video at room temperature without overheating.

Excellent price for what you get. High quality stills and impressive video. Very light and easy to handle.

If you shoot video there is one annoying issue. The new in-body stabilization system (IBIS) makes it easy to shoot handheld stills and video. Unfortunately the IBIS (which can not be disabled) makes a low humming noise that is picked up by the in-camera mic when shooting video. This can be addressed by purchasing and using an external microphone such as a Rode VideoMicro (the camera has an mic jack to plug it in). Not fatal but something to be aware of."

The camera looks good and is easy to use but picture quality and especially the focus on this camera is not there. It takes almost a second sometimes to focus and the camera seems to be very slow. If you use the stacking option or buster/fast mode is ok, but you can't do that on every occasion. The menu is simple but some options are inactive in some menus. The extras on this camera are very nice but without a good focus you can't use the camera at full potential. Shame Panasonic for not having a decent focus!!!"

I have the Olympus EM5 ii and it is not an issue at all. And an external microphone is a stupid option. I bought 4/3 for small/portability, not to piece together a production studio. Other than the usability being a bit better, for the same money or even a bit cheaper, the em5 ii is a much better engineered/mfg product. Too bad because i did like the panasonic controls, but not at the sacrifice of stupid design flaws. In terms of stills, its personal preference, but i think the em5ii is better. Not i'm using panasonid 12-35/2.8, 35-100/2.8 and 100-400 lenses."

In the last year I realized that the perfect camera doesn't, and probably never will, exist. Like almost everything in life, camera design is all about compromise. This was a very important discovery because it made me focus on the things that were most important in a camera, which turned out to be image quality, portability, and speed.

IMAGE QUALITY
Prior to this camera I have owned multiple Canon, Nikon, and Sony, APS-C cameras, and also rented a full-frame Nikon. I could go on for a while about what I think about each brand's stengths and weaknesses when it comes to IQ, but suffice it to say that I think they are all good in some ways and not good in others. This is my first Fuji and simply put, I am more happy with the results, more of the time, than I have ever been with any other camera. Image Quality, to me, really boils down to realistic reproduction, and I think Fuji nails it. So often before, when I looked at a photo I took, it was just a little off to me and didn't really ""catch"" whatever it was that I was taking a picture of. Of course, a lot of that must have been user error, but with this camera, when I look at the pictures, I think ""yes, that is what I was taking a picture of!""

PORTABILITY
I dabble in all kinds of photography, but the majority of the time I'm taking pictures, it's when I'm out and about or on a hike so this camera would seem like a natural choice. However, I most enjoy shooting at high-normal, and telephoto, focal lengths - I rarely shoot below 45mm equivalent - so I thought it would be out of the question. But I was lucky to stumble onto two pieces of information about this camera that made all the difference. The first is that this camera has a smart-teleconverter function, which zooms in to 50mm and 70mm equivalents. Of course, the results aren't quite as good as using an actual 50 or 70mm lens, but with 26 megapixels, they're plenty good for me. The only negative I will say here is that while using the 70mm function, the image is a little blurry in the EVF so it is harder to be certain of focus, but it's not too bad. The other thing I learned about this camera which made me pull the trigger is that Fuji sells an actual converter to 50mm for $350! With zero reduction in image quality or f-stop. It obviously makes it a bit bulkier, but it is still plenty portable for me. All of that is to say, that even for someone like me who usually carried a telephoto zoom, normal zoom, and a 50mm prime, this camera covers enough of the range to be happy with. And the trade-off in weight and space saved makes up for the small sacrifice made on the focal length side, many times over. Just after buying this camera I took a three-nighter to Bryce Canyon and I absolutely fell in love. I can't describe how giddy I was hopping around the trails with this camera securely slung cross-body. I passed so many people with huge cameras hanging around their necks, either banging into them with every step or they had to hold them the entire time. I used to be one of those people and the difference is massive. Of course, the best part was when I looked at my pictures each night on my laptop and realized the pictures were coming out, for the first time in my life, as good as I had hoped them to be! If I had been using a Sony or Nikon full-frame, I would have gotten a little more dynamic range out of the shots (and don't get me wrong I would have liked that) but having to carry all that extra weight and gear would not have been worth it.

SPEED
I think the thing that has always attracted me most to Fuji is the dedicated dials and now that I have had them, I don't think I can go back. For some people, these dials might actually slow them down, because the front and rear dials that most cameras have, are usually dedicated to changing SS and aperture, and that is actually faster than the dials on Fuji cameras. But for me, against all logic, Fuji's implementation is just more intuitive, and therefore, faster. It also helps me because I know what the camera is set at, without having to look through the viewfinder or the screen. That way, I can separate composing my shot and exposing my shot which I find more effective, and also more satisfying.

MISC
- The best reviews I have seen for Fuji in general are by Phil Porto on YouTube. He doesn't get wrapped up in the nitty-gritty, technical details, but talks more about how it feels to use Fuji.
- I wish the ""Q"" menu was customizable
- I wish it had one or two more customizable buttons
- the OVF / EVF is so awesome! I love the feeling of getting my exposure set and then only using the OVF for composition. It just feels more connected to me than using a screen."

I could see the world was moving away from the DSLR (I had a Canon 6D -- great camera) and wanted to see what the fuss was about. The X100V is a great camera that includes everything you need to explore photography in one easy-to-carry-around package: Camera, flash, Neutral Density filter (this is a straight darkening filter to get things under control in very bright sun), all with manual controls which you can use as much or as little as you desire. Great package for those who want something more than their smartphone camera but don't want to carry around a lot of gear.

Now, one of the key problems people seem to have with this camera (and other Fuji cameras) is the use of the Fuji ""Cam Remote"" app which you need on your phone to transfer pictures to your phone wirelessly. I had some frustrations too, but it turns out the key problem is that the manual doesn't explain things very well, and the menus on the camera are confusing too. Here's what has worked for me and is very reliable (take note, this info is for the X100V; I have no other Fuji cameras and have not tested it on any others):

1) Turn on ""Wireless Communication"". This item is in the ""Shooting Menu"" (the one with the little camera icon) on page 3/3 of that menu. This seems to be the key point of confusion. Fuji should really put this item in the ""Connection Settings"" menu (which is under the ""tool"" icon) to be logically consistent. Anyway, turning this on (by simply clicking on it in the menus) causes the camera to create its own wi-fi network, called ""Fuji... something or other"".

2) Now, go into the settings on your iPhone or iPad (once again, I am in the Apple world; I do not know for sure if this works the same way under Android, but I assume so) and connect your iDevice to the new Fuji wi-fi network. Note: once you do this successfully, you are connected to the camera and NOT to the internet since the camera, of course, does not have an internet connection (unlike your phone, which probably does have such a connection).

3) Go back to the Fuji Cam Remote app and NOW open it up. You should now be able to click (in the app) on ""Import images selected on app"". That part of the app should now open up and show you thumbnails of the images on your phone. You can select images and move them to your phone. Once you reconect to your original wi-fi (with an internet connection; you can, of course, use your phone's cell internet connection, like 5G, if you have that) you can then upload images to Instagram or whatever else you want to do.

I'm putting this in the simplest way possible here in the hope that is most helpful. There are some minor complications you might run into; for instance, if I switch between my iPhone and my iPad then after step 2 I have to click the ""ok"" button on the camera to allow the phone, or iPad, to connect to the camera. This is explained pretty clearly on the screen of the phone during this process. Also, although the manual, and the menus, talk about ""pairing"" a device to the camera before doing all of this, I find that with my camera and phone I don't have to go through the pairing. What matters is turning on the Fuji wifi, connecting the iDevice to it, THEN opening the app.

I hope this helps. It seems a shame that so many reviews knock the camera because they are having this trouble with the app. I found this information in a Fuji users discussion board and for me, it makes the app totally reliable and usable. That's another lesson here: this is a popular camera and if you have questions or problems, it's very likely they have come up and been discussed in one of the internet chat groups devoted to Fuji stuff. So, start your Google and find your answers. ;-). Good luck with this great camera, everyone.

Nov. 2022 -- Cannot believe what the world has been through since I bought this camera 2.5 years ago! Just want to add, as of updating to iOS 16 in October 2022, getting the Fuji iPhone/iPad app to connect to my camera has gotten a little tricky. Presumably in updates over the next month or two (to iOS and/or to Fuji firmware) this will get sorted out. Also just a general point: I still think this is a great camera, but it does seem to me that the larger sensor size of a ""full-frame"" camera, like my old Canon 6D, does make a difference. My impression is that the 6D was better in very low light, and generally produced more amazing shots just by being a full-frame camera. But there's still a lot to love about this beautiful one-camera solution model, with flash, ND filter, lens, as I mentioned before..."

And i rented its previous model twice, and was generally pleased. So, how come it isn't a 5 star love fest? Because for $1,400 Fuji is claiming a very high bar. And i work for my money. So we are going to get into it.

Where i ding it worst is ergonomics. The simulated black texture material is slippery. I get that it has a more 'retro' look, but at the expense of grip and slipperiness? Next, they could have added a thumb rest on the back, but they didn't. The ridge on the front is slightly increased, but still not enough to get a good grip. So you are going to want/need a thumb rest from LensMate or similar. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the direct controls, the aperture ring on the lens, the visible shutter speed and ISO, etc. All that's much appreciated. But why not give us the whole package. I want to be comfortable shooting with this camera, not staring at it on a shelf in my room.

Next, image quality. Its good, and if the light is good, it can make some nice jpegs. The color modes are fun. But the colors are NOT natural. The greens are loaded up with additional blue that isn't there in the original picture. Hey, if you like that, great. But if you want realistic natural world colors, this isn't it. But it can also make some really mushy looking files too if the light isn't strong. I use and edit in raw formats. It is up there with Sony and Nikon in terms of dynamic range, beating my canon APSC camera. But i don't agree that the XTran sensor makes for better files. It does seem to have a bit lower noise, but it is no where near what a full frame can do. My spiff with this sensor is how edges are rendered. They simply don't produce natural looking texture and edges. Take the edges of flower petals and stalks...very artificial and constructed looking, not at all organic compared to my nikon and canon. I have both (77D and D7500) and i'll take their raw files to work with any day of the week for this reason.

Next, the lens is really improved over earlier iterations. But even though its a 35mm equivalent lens and generally you wouldn't think you need image stabilization, i had an odd number of photos that weren't quite sharp due to shake/blur. Perhaps that's due to the worse grip ergonomics? Long story short, i get sharper images with more natural looking files and truer colors, and nicer color gradations with my Canon 77D fit with my 24mm f2.8. Yeah there's a bit more noise in them, but i can work with that. And it cost me MUCH less. Oh, and i can swap out lenses if i want to. Sorry Fuji, I'm sending it back.

Update of 12/31/2020 - I noticed a few folks commented on this review with remarks that made me think it might be helpful if i tried to provide a bit more context for my remarks. First, I DID purchase and use this camera for a good bit during the time period allowed before it needed to be returned. I've also rented and used its earlier model multiple times for a total of several weeks. Second, when i speak about comparing image quality output of this camera versus others, my experience includes not just the Canon 77D, but a number of APSC Nikon DSLRs and also full frame cameras from both Canon and Nikon. Additionally, i've owned and used the Fuji X-T20 for a good bit. To elaborate then, IMHO these recent 24 and 26 megapixel-sensored Fujis are quite good. They have a bit lower noise than my Canon crop sensor cameras, but aren't as good as Nikon's recent 20 megapixel D7500 and Z50. The Fujis DO have better dynamic range than my canons, and they are probably comparable to my Nikon. Third, i use Lightroom for all my raw conversion. So my comments about edge delineation and resolution may be a function of using LR. I DO stand by my comments on Fuji's colors. Some may love them. And the various film simulations are a lot of fun to experiment with. But i don't think they are particularly true to life. I did try to emphasize that i DO love this camera's design intent. But i would hope we could all be open to appreciating that design intent, and execution of final product aren't always one and the same. (e.g. again, i think there is room for improvement with the camera's ergonomics). And if they could put IBIS in this camera, i'd be putting in another order tomorrow. (I suspect, or hope, that Fuji will more likely add it to a future version of the X-Pro series). So, it comes down to whether i can feel good about putting $1400 of my hard earned money into this camera model versus other uses. Due to that consideration, i sent this model back. I hope this helps people who may be considering this camera."

Puntos negativos
al momento de grabar vídeo, se escucha el motor de autoenfoque muchisiisisisimo osea casi igual que las voces de lo que grabas, eso no me gustó para nada 😭

Ni tampoco que no trae cargador..

Respecto a la batería, dura tal cual se marca en las especificaciones, unos 450 disparos, me parece que dura muy poco para tener esa batería tan grande pero en fin :(
Solo recuerda cargarla antes de días importantes (la tienes que cargar 5-6 horas en tu pc por USB)
No puedes enviar videos raw a tu cel mediante la app (sólo fotos)

Puntos positivos
Las fotos que produce estan hermosas
Viene con recipes para que puedas tomar fotos con ""filtros"" ahí mismo en la cámara
Puedes conectar a tu cel súper fácil
Puedes personalizar tooodo los botones, eso me encantó
La pantalla es tactil y se mueve un poco, muy útil, yo le compre unas micas para protegerla
Esta hermosa, recibirás muchos cumplidos 😂 lmao

I have shot with numerous Fujifilm Mirrorless cameras; XT1, XT2, XT3, XE3, XPro1 but my favorite digital cameras of all time are the X100 series. With heavy experience with the X100S, T and F, the V hit all the marks that I would have hoped for bringing me back to the beloved X100V. I have been traveling the world with a Fujifilm Mirrorless camera by my side most of the time and the X100V is without a doubt a travel/street/documentary/family/everyday photographer’s best tool as it will always come with you. The updates to the V makes this version of the X100 so capable in such a small form factor. The weather sealing, the new iso dial, the tilting screen, the new lens, the larger brighter viewfinder, the performance and more just puts this over the top. If you have a T or before, it’s an absolute upgrade if you have been waiting or wanting to burn some of that hard saved money. From the F to the V, if you’re on a budget the F is a gem of a camera, but if you don’t worry about the extra cash, upgrade and don’t look back, you won’t. I’ll be posting photos soon to Instagram @thedharmalife as nearly 90% of those photos are all shot with Fujifilm cameras with a 23mm (35mm FF) lens and many with the X100 series line of cameras.

Only two things if I were to be very picky as the updates already put these as small gripes. Firstly, I miss the D-Pad for the extra programmable short cuts. I have not liked the touch swipes as short cuts. Secondly, the tripod mount, blocks the battery and SD card slot when on a tripod or capture clip is attached.

FYI: Lensmate X100F thumb grip is not compatible with X100V

Older Fujifilm leather cases are not compatible with the X100V

You may have to get a plastic screen protector (not glass) while this a new release because you will probably need to trim to fit the beautiful tilting display. If they come out with a perfect fitting glass sometime in the future, I recommend that.

If you need a case, Op/Tech makes a few that’s fits; the body, the compact D and their soft pouch easy close 523. If you aren’t using a lens hood go with the Op/Tech body. If you have the adapter and lens protector and still want to use the lens cover go with the compact d. If you prefer a quicker in and out go with their soft pouch easy close as it states it is easier I just don’t like the fit personally.

DM me if you have more questions on IG, otherwise, what are you waiting for? Fujifilm has another winner on their hands and there is nothing else on the market that competes with it for output and cost."

Other reviewers talk about the film simulations, outstanding image sharpness, hybrid viewfinder, small size, light weight etc.

My background is as a professional photographer 35 years ago using film. (Nikon FE2s, Mamiya medium format). Now that I'm older I just can't carry a heavy camera, so I ditched my Nikon D750; this Fuji does everything I could ask of a camera, and more.

I'm old enough to be intimidated by menu options, but the control dials make this camera easy for anyone to operate. The flip-up screen makes low level shots easy, but also can be used like the ground glass screen on my old Rolleiflex twin-lens reflex which used to be my fav travel camera.

I recently did some family portraits which were so sharp I was able to crop them on the computer with no noticeable lack of resolution. I shoot LARGE/ FINE JPEGs and the quality is amazing. Using the Q button it's easy to change image quality and to switch between colour and b&w.

Some reviewers call this a ""point & shoot"" camera - yes it can be, but also so much more.
My only reservation is the reason I bought it in the first place - the fixed lens. It's small and very sharp, 35mm equivalent focal length. Sometimes I need different focal lengths, and for that reason am going to buy an X-T3.

But the X100V is a great take-anywhere camera, and I recommend it. At the time of this review it seems to be in short supply, and only available used on Amazon. Glad I got mine when I did."

Its beautiful design is complimented by its robust features, adding up to a shooting experience that somehow transcends those tangible things. I’m genuinely compelled by this camera to see the mundane of the world with fresh eyes. I can’t tell you this camera will do that for you, but it definitely does for me. It’s like an extension of my creative will, manifested into the form of this camera.

The tilt screen is a bit stiff, but not to the point of concern or more importantly, stymying getting a quick shot (see the overhead looking down stairs photo which was taken in less than 10 seconds). The new lens is sharp and performance snappy. Battery life lives up to what Fuji claims as far as I can tell, but I’ll be getting a second battery in any case. I’m actually a fan of the USB-C charging because USB-C chargers are more likely to be encountered in the wild rather than a Fuji battery charger which makes top ups a bit more feasible and carrying less gear possible. The economics of a half pressed shutter and rolling the rear command dial in one hand is a bit tricky, leading to an occasional unintended photo, but frankly there are other ways to address that on this camera. The deep menus and settings open up a wide array of possibilities which can be intimidating, the case for me in my first minutes with the X100V. My response? Skim the manual and then just take it outside and shoot. Play with it. Have fun. Enjoy learning as I go.

I did not forget to try the film simulations. I adore them. Classic Neg and Acros are my favorites and what you’d get if you ripped out of my head what I imagine with my eyes closed. This pair is a like a rare Hollywood power couple where everyone agrees, these two are magical together.

As an owner of the X100T, this camera is a great upgrade. The weather resistance gives me the confidence to shoot in places that would have given me pause before.

I could go into detail about all the technical things this camera does but there are better sources for that than me. What I can tell you is that the X100V resonates with me, it speaks to me and the way I shoot in an intuitive way. Whatever flaws might exist in this camera, I don’t care. And I don’t care because I’ll be too busy shooting with it.

The photos included in this review are from my first meaningful session with the X100V. No alterations or retouching other than a wireless transfer to my phone and whatever compression Amazon applied."

I was shooting on an X100F previously that I absolutely love, and so have definitely drunk the single lens kool-aid of the X100 series. The X100V has taken that base formula and expanded nicely from the X100F, with more modern features (namely USB-C charging and a flip out screen) and improved image quality with a new sensor and fixed lens. All great stuff. My issue with this has been the quality control.

As with any new release, you’re subject to some growing pains, and unfortunately the X100V has had a few in terms of fit and finish. The unit I received has had issues with grinding in the manual focus ring. It seems like the main focus ring is slightly offset, and so will grind against the metal housing when you turn. The Auto-focus system is also generally much louder than the X100F, and really any of the current gen x-series cameras I’ve used. The cap as well, which normally fits on and slides off very smoothly is no where near as smooth as the X100F, and kind of pops off instead of sliding off. The camera does get quite hot in use over the battery, where you thumb holds the camera body.

Compared to the X100F this just hasn’t been as refined an experience - it feels rough around the edges, and at just over $2000 taxes in for a brand new release like this, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Mind you all of the amazing things about image quality, usability and design that other reviewers talk about is indeed there, but this falls flat on a lot of these fit and finish elements. I expect that these issues will be ironed out over time, and from what I’ve read on forums fujifilm has been generally quite good about fixing these issues under warranty. In addition, Fujifilm is well known for supporting their cameras extensively through firmware support.

So overall, definitely a great camera but one I might wait a little bit to pick up so they can work out some of those kinks."

I bought it for my street photography as well as a travel camera for some trips. I say that because if I were to go somewhere I really wanted to photograph I would be bringing my full frame camera. Great 26mp sensor, built in ND filter, Fuji Film simulations, and great color sciences. I wish it was truly weather sealed without having to spend another 100 dollars to buy the filter kit. If you want an all around camera, look at the X-S10 or X-T3 (while you can find one). If you want good FF at this price, the Nikon Z5 is a fantastic option (video not being it's strong suit)."

It can be a simple point and shoot. Someone who knows nothing about cameras can take it right out of the box and shoot excellent pictures just using the factory automatic settings. Or it can be as complex as anything out there. Camera geeks can fiddle with it forever with its almost infinite manual adjustments. I haven't had much time to get to know this camera. So I have only been shooting with its factory automatic settings - aperture priority, auto shutter & auto ISO. And I will dare say, that the pictures I am getting are as good as any professional can shoot. You be the judge! This is a excellent camera. Fuji really hit a grand slam home run with the X100V. Get one if you can, but I think they are hard to find."

If you're buying it because it also has WiFi and Bluetooth - imo they are awful. I've had the camera for a month. *I think* I've finally figured out how to connect to an iPad Pro, but I'm not sure I can repeat it. Connecting to a non-Bluetooth desktop through a home router - forget it, I tried it, life is too short.

The required Fuji Camera Remote app for device connectivity has an unfriendly user interface (IOW, a lot of guess work is needed). The camera manual is no help. At the minimum you'll need to visit the Fuji website.

One more significant thing: After finally getting camera and iPad connected via Bluetooth, I learned you can't import RAW files. (I don't know if it's the Camera Remote app or iOS.) I only shoot RAW so to get photos to the iPad Pro I use a third-party card reader just as I did when shooting a Sony a6000.

Love the camera, image quality and Fujifilm presets. Wireless = lousy."

I started with a Nikon D90, to a Sony A7, and finally this Fuji x100v.

No IBIS, not a deal breaker. New lens elements for sharper and less distorted images wide open, better touch screen interface and the joystick is amazing.

Those reasons were enough to get a brand new x100v over a used x100f for less than half price.
Camera use is snappy and quick, no evf lag as far as I can tell compared to my A7.
If you're not used to manual dials for aperture, iso, and shutter it will take some getting used to.

My only complaints would be the camera getting warm near the battery area due to the circuitry changes needed to introduce a swivel screen (which is also nice). Fuji would address this in some way with a firmware update. Please check time of writing to see relevancy to this complaint.
This camera is noticeably heavier, or at least the weight distribution is right-side dominant when compared to x100f and older models. Probably a result of the circuitry changes, hand fatigue will occur no matter how much you do grip exercises. The strap the camera comes with is thin and in my opinion not very good.
I ordered a wrist strap which would be great enough for this.

I have been a fan of the X100 series since it came out and owned several iterations, including the X100f. Despite the unique positives and negatives of each iteration, there has been one nagging issue that, for me, stood out above all other shortcomings......the lens.

Consider it done.

The lens upgrade or fix or redesign or whatever you want to call it has made the lens shortcoming a thing of the past. My only experience and advice is, if you have wanted to love the X100 series, but just couldn't make peace with the lens.......the wait is over. The lens on the X100V is sharper and better in every way. I did a side by side compare of my X-T3 with 23mm f1.4 and the X100V, both set at f2, and the results were so satisfyingly similar. The 23/1.4 was better, but not by much. The old X100 lens was just too soft and so not the equal of the camera.

In my experience, the final piece of the X100 puzzle is complete. A truly great lens on a truly great camera."

It's almost the perfect camera in every way. The build quality is fantastic and it feels so good in the hands. It's an absolute joy to shoot with as well. The updated lens is super sharp, even wide open and at close-up distances. Everything is in the right place and the manual controls work so well.

Image quality is fantastic and about as good as you can get out of a modern APS-C camera. I no longer need to shoot in Raw as I find the jpgs to be more than adequate. I enjoy the film simulations which are professional as opposed to other manufacturers simulations which are more ""gimmicky"" and ""toyish"". No complaints in the image department.

There are a few negatives though. Gone is the 4 way controller and you're forced to have to swipe the rear screen to replicate the missing controller. I'm not a fan of swiping as it's not as intuitive and there is some lag to the swipes. Also not a fan of the recessed buttons because there harder to feel when you're looking through the viewfinder. I like the buttons on the previous X100F model much better."

It is amazing how compact and feature packed is this camera. It is a fun to use with all mechanical tactile and compactness that makes you bring it anywhere.
Having a fixed lens is also great as you do not spend a lot of money on lenses and carry them around. Instead you can concentrate on capturing the great moments of your life and your beloved ones.
You can always buy wide or telephoto converters. I have a wide converter that I occasionally use for landscape photography.
If you want to zoom you can digitally zoom and you will not be disappointed as image quality is great and new lens produces sharp and vivid images.
I owned Fujifilm X100F and I loved it although there were a couple of missing features such as weather sealing and fast autofocus.
I live in Montreal, Canada and weather can be harsh at times so having weather sealing is a great addition.
Besides, camera is improved in many aspects. Faster and better autofocus, tilting touch-enabled screen, higher quality body build, and longer battery life are some of the improvements.
In short, it is such a joyful and capable camera!"

Very nice little camera. Absolutely no problems with the copy I received.
Update: Going on 2 months with this camera now and I'm still quite satisfied with it. It is a departure from a DSLR, but I find myself quite happy with this camera.
Focal length: The fixed focal length is good for so many things. I've very seldom wished I had a zoom lens on this camera, and the close-focusing ability makes getting in close very fun.
Film simulations: Normally I shoot my DSLR in RAW mode, but I find myself often just shooting JPEGs with this camera. Skin tones are amazing and the JPEG usually takes very little post processing.
Controls: They take some getting used to, but despite the learning curve, I find using this camera generally very easy. I don't miss the D-pad and find the joystick very useful.
In conclusion, I do not regret dropping the money on this camera."

Some background on my previous cameras: Canon T3i, Canon 7D MkI, Canon 6D Mki, Fuji X100T, Sony A7 Mk3. I’ve had the X100T for less than a year and it was in no way comparable to Canon 6D that I owned during the same time. Mainly the noise at high iso and very poor focus performance at low/mid light. My last camera Sony A7 mk3 was probably the best camera I’ve had owned, I won’t go into it as you can just watch YouTube videos to see why it’s considered to be one of the best. When I purchased X100V I was a little hesitant as I thought I might be disappointed coming from A7 but I was very surprised with the snappy focus and good high iso performance. It’s a keeper and I will recommend it to anyone that wants a compact camera that has features of high end cameras. Love it!"

I first had a Pentax K5 and bought the Fuji X100 in 2011 and I LOVED the skin tones and that 12MP sensor. But I am also an ambient light shooter, and I became seduced by the Sony alpha 7S (also with a 12MP sensor) with it's usable ISO soaring into the 24,000+ range! So I sold my X100. I also bought the Sony RX100 and exchanged it for the RX100IV.

I bought the X100V because of the improved lens resolution, the hybrid (optical + EVF), higher usable ISO range, the tilt screen, the joystick, and the Fuji film simulations. The X100V is the only camera that gives me JPEGS I can use straight out of camera. Also, I rated ""zoom"" because the X100V has a ""digital tele-extender"" that, by my turning the outer lens ring, shifts from 35mm equivalent to 50mm equivalent to 70mm equivalent focal lengths. This is a wonderful plus!"

I won't be using the flip screen much but it's nice to know it's there and it's very discrete!

Lastly it should be noted that the X100V OEM lens cap appears to be slightly larger than previous versions which means that it won't fit over aftermarket hoods well.

However, I cannot say the same thing about the x100V. It feels cheaper and more plastic-like than the x100F.

I dropped my x100V on the sidewalk as I was sitting down, maybe a 12 inch drop, and the base plate is horribly dented and is starting to separate from the rest of the body. I have used tape for now to cover the dented part and protect it from further damage, but I will have to send it into Fuji in the winter, when I am not shooting so much, for a repair.

My advice is to be careful, this camera is not as durable as the previous model, however, the lens is amazing, auto focus is noticeably improved, and it is perfect in every other way.

***UPDATE***
I changed my review after my experience with Fuji’s repair department in Edison, NJ. Essentially I sent my camera in to repair the damage, and they did not do what was requested and charged me $283 to replace the battery compartment, which itself was fine. Then when I contacted them to report that I got my camera back and the work requested was not completed, they told me it would be an additional charge, and would not provide me a price. The person on the phone was extremely rude and unhelpful.

I will never buy a Fuji camera ever again."

It is NOT that water resistant. I got caught in the rain and mostly kept the camera in my rain coat pocket. It did get rained on but not nearly as much rain as I have subjected my Sony A7III to. When I got home, the viewfinder on my x100v was fogged up with a substantial amount of water (see photo). I was able to dry it out and the camera is still working, but there are water spots inside the viewfinder. I am disappointed this area of the camera wasn't sealed better. It seems like there is no seal around the viewfinder adjustment wheel, which is where I am guessing that water got in. FYI, I had a lens filter covering the camera the entire time, and the lens itself didn't get any moisture inside of it. Fujifilm says I would have to mail them the camera for evaluation to see if it was defective, which didn't sound promising and not worth it for a working camera. I bought the V over the older and $400 cheaper model specially because of weather resistance. I love the camera otherwise. You should seriously consider buying it. But don't spend more money for weather sealing if you are debating the V and F. I was hoping to take it out hiking more, and now I am not sure if I can do that."

We’ll get to that in a minute.

Here’s the scoop: I moved from Canon to Fuji in late 2016 when Fuji released the XT-2. Fuji changed my entire world. It introduced me to the world of mirrorless and I ain’t never going back to DSLR life!

For one year I shot with the XT-2, posting all of my work across the interwebs and convincing people of its magical abilities. I shot everything with the XT-2: commercial jobs, corporate video, agency shoots, personal work, family get-togethers. Even my honeymoon in Thailand. Ah yes, the Fuji and I have made some fantastic memories together. “This is the only camera I ever need,” I whispered to myself one night while tucking the Fuji to sleep.

Oh, how wrong I was.

Flash forward a few nights later. “Dude, you hear about the new Sony coming out?” my friend Eric texted me. It must have been around midnight, right about the time our conversation always seems to center around gear lust.

“You gonna sell the Fuji and get it?” he goaded me.

“No way,” I shot back. “I don’t really need another camera,” I said, seemingly trying to convince both him and myself.

But then I started thinking. I had recently sold off all my Canon gear, so I only had the XT-2. What kind of professional photographer would I be with only one camera body? Sony *did* have a reputation for making good cameras. And the a7RIII supposedly had a lot of improvements over the previous version. Maybe I could just take a quick peek at the specs and see what it offered. No harm, no foul, right?

Twenty minutes later, my cursor is hovering over the “Add to Cart” button as I struggle to keep myself from salivating all over my laptop. “Here goes nothing,” I said as I pre-ordered the camera.

That was November 5th. I had to wait an excruciating four weeks before the camera finally arrived at my apartment. Since then, I’ve taken it out for several portrait sessions and can confirm: This camera is one seriously bad-ass machine. Let’s take a look at my top five favorite factors:

1) 42 Megapixels

I know, I know. Megapixels aren’t everything. Sure, I agree. BUT FORTY TWO OF THEM?! That’s some serious resolution power! To compare, the Fuji XT-2 offers 24.3mp, which, let’s be real, is more than enough for most photographers. But having 70% more resolution is just insane. The level of detail in its RAW images is astounding. And I love not being afraid to crop my photos for fear of losing quality.

2) 120fps (Slow-mo)

Since getting into video last year, I’ve been having a lot of fun shooting slow-mo clips, especially for b-roll footage. The Fuji XT-2 handles video exceptionally well. It might not be the ideal camera for more serious jobs that require long shooting times or heavy post-work, but for smaller gigs, it’s fantastic.

That being said, one thing it’s missing is the ability to shoot at 120fps. I convinced myself I didn’t *need* this feature, but man I really wanted it.
Enter the a7RIII. Its slow-mo feature is buttery smooth, and the quality is exceptional. I love the “S&Q” option, that lets you capture and playback the footage in slow-mo right in the camera. No longer do I have to settle for shooting 60fps.

3) Battery life

I can’t really compare to the a7RII since I never owned it. But I will say this, I’m seriously impressed with the a7RIII’s NP-FZ100 battery. I went out and did two portrait sessions, shooting for maybe three hours total, and didn’t even use 10%! While the Fuji XT-2 certainly doesn’t have a bad battery life, I can’t say it’s quite as good as the Sony’s.

4) Eye-AF

Guys, this one is seriously a game-changer. Eye-AF already existed before this camera, but not quite like this. Again, comparing it to the XT-2 is like comparing night and day. While the XT-2 might identify your subject’s eye, forget about precision if they’re moving around at all. The a7RIII, on the other hand, locks onto your subject’s eyes with pinpoint accuracy. They could spin around like the Tasmanian Devil and you could have peace of mind that their eyes will still be in focus. It’s SCARY impressive.

Provided that I have good light, all I have to do is hit the center button (where eye-AF is set to by default) and I never EVER have to worry about nailing focus for my portraits. The only times I’ve experienced issues is when my subjects’ faces aren’t exposed too well, forcing the camera to “guess” their eyes are. (Sometimes this results in the camera placing the green square somewhere in the background, which is absolutely frightening, as I imagine it’s picking up the eyes of some invisible ghoul, but I digress.)

5) Shooting continuous at 10fps

If you like shooting action, this one is a real treat. Unless you’re coming from the a9 (which shoots at a mind-blowing 20fps), you’re sure to be delighted with the ability to shoot continuously at 10 frames per second. As a portrait photographer, I’ll often ask my subjects to walk, run, or jump in an effort to capture natural movement. Nailing these shots can be challenging if the camera doesn’t shoot at a fast enough frame rate.

Though the a7RIII only offers 2 more frames-per-second than the XT-2, here’s where it really shines: Combining eye-AF with the continuous shutter. These two features are a powerful combination, practically guaranteeing that I nail focus for any intentional or unexpected movement.

Bottom line:

Though I’m known amongst my photographer friends as a fervent Fuji fan, the Sony a7RIII is an irresistible package. I have absolutely no regrets over buying it.

Does the Sony replace the XT-2? That depends on what you shoot and what features you appreciate the most in a camera. In my opinion, Fuji is second to none with color science. Their baked-in film simulations are a delight to use. I love the simplicity of their menu system, along with their nostalgic build of their camera bodies.

But when it comes to features and specifications, the a7RIII is hard to beat. With medium-format-like resolution, incredibly precise eye-autofocus, and the ability to capture most movement with its 10fps, this camera is a sure winner.

My first digital camera was the Canon Rebel XTi -> Canon EOS 60D -> Canon EOS 6D -> Sony A7ii -> Sony A7Riii. I have also shot with the Sony A7Rii and a few other recent Canon mirrorless cameras like the EOS M and M3.

In November of 2016 I made the switch from my 6D to Sony after borrowing a friend’s a7ii for a week. I loved it and it fit my workflow perfectly. I was immediately a fan. I used that camera every day. Fast forward to the announcement of the A7Riii a couple months back and it was the perfect time to upgrade.

My focus is photography, but I wanted to be able to shoot 4K video for some projects at work too. I have had my A7Riii for a little over a week now. The slightly different shape is an immediate improvement for me. I have bigger hands and the Sony mirrorless cameras have always been a tad hard to hold on to. The slightly deeper body is actually one of my favorite changes. I picked up the Gariz leather half-case made for the A9 (Gariz XS-CHA9BK) and it fits like a charm and adds just a little more height to the camera as well. I HIGHLY recommend the half-case for people with larger hands, it gives my pinky a place to rest.

The image quality out of this camera is insane, but I have used the A7Rii a bit and it is no different, so that is not a surprise. But for people not coming from the A7Rii, the detail you can get out of these sensors blows my mind.

Video quality is good, I am just getting started with this area of creativity and am learning. But the ability to shoot flat is great. I am excited to be able to expand in this area.

Battery life is great. I personally never have had a problem with carrying a few extra batteries in my pocket. I drove around Iceland for a week with the A7ii and 4 batteries and did fine. But this camera obviously has a much more impressive battery, something I will never say no to.
Build quality is something you expect from a camera at this price point. The fitment is great, the buttons feel wonderful.

RAW support is something I am patiently waiting for since I use Lightroom. There is a simple EXIF hack to change the camera ID to an A7Rii to get them in Lightroom, but still waiting for official support. (This is 100% on Adobe, but still a point to make)

The viewfinder is beautiful. Coming from the A7ii, this makes a big difference. I still have not decided if I use the viewfinder or the LCD more, probably evenly split. But nonetheless the viewfinder is better, that’s welcome.

Finally, Autofocus. I can not even begin to explain this. I know the A9 is faster, I know Canon and Nikon have cameras that are faster. But I have NEVER used a camera with autofocus like this one. I have always shot single-focus center point and just “focus and recompose” so that I can quickly get what I want in focus in focus. However, this is the first time in my life I have shot with a camera and I feel it focuses quickly and accurately. I shoot a lot with fast lenses and so focus is very important. This camera absolutely nails it. The subject tracking is incredible, the eye tracking is incredible.

In conclusion, if you read this far you have probably already watched every YouTube review on this camera and visited this page 100 times. If you can afford one, you’ll probably get one. If you can’t, you’ll probably save for one. Maybe this review helped someone, that’s all I hope. Take care everyone, and keep on shooting!"

I'm a semiprofessional photographer who makes most of my money shooting headshots and other forms of portraiture. With the image quality produced by the A7RII being just short of that produced by a 45mp or 50mp medium format camera, the Sony A7RII does an excellent job enabling me to produce high resolution, sharp portraits.

But I've also been called upon to do other types of photography work, such as low light events and sporting events, and that's where the A7RII falls short and underperforms, impeding me from doing my job efficiently. So, I bought an A6500 for speed and a D750 for low light to help compensate for the A7RII's shortcomings, in that regard.

Truthfully, the D750 may not produce images as sharp as those the Sonys are capable of producing in good lighting, but the D750 with a 20mm or a 70-200mm Tamrom Way outperforms any Sony in low light--yes, including the A7RIII (the new one, that is).

Anyway, the Sonys produce super sharp images with native lenses and non-native lenses with good adapters, but they tend to perform poorly in low light, relative to Nikons.

Back to the A7RIII and why it is better than the A7RII and probably the best all-around camera in the world:

I know folks like to say that the A7RII and the A7RIII have same sensor. While that may be more or less accurate, the truth is that they don't have the same technology processing the data (light) captured by the sensor, and this fact shows significantly in the images produced by the respective processors, not the sensors. In other words: The sensor is akin to a retina and the processor is akin to a brain. The brain in the A7RIII is way way better than the brain in the A7RII.

For example: I own a manual focus lens, with which I use focus peaking, manual focus assist, etc. The focus peaking between the A7RII and the A7RIII is like apples to oranges. The focus peaking in the A7RIII is, IMO, two or three times better, enabling me to nail focus with a manual focus lens as if it were a semi-autofocus lens. And with the clearer viewfinder and LCD, it's even better. That's a big deal.

Other examples are with autofocusing capability (particularly, eye-autofocus), pixel-shifting, sensor stabilization (5 Axis). All of those things are big deals. If your sensor can't acquire focus, then it's not all that good of sensor.

A couple other upgrades I really like:
The flash sync port is extremely useful for me, as I would call myself a flash/studio photographer.
The dual card slot is excellent, because knowing that you're not at risk of losing hours of prep and shooting to a faulty card is a Big Deal!

The extended battery life is cool, but not consequential to me, unless I'm shooting video.
The increased frame rate is awesome, making my A6500 pretty much useless to me, unless I'm looking to put the lightest body I can on a gimbal.

In a nutshell, the A7RIII is hands down well-worth it if you're looking for an all-in-one camera. It is undoubetedly superior, in many ways, to the A7RII. With the A7RIII, you no longer need to buy the A6500, as the A7RIII has all the capabilities of the A7RII and A6500 plus more.

I highly recommend the A7RIII and Samy's Camera shipped it to me in mint condition via FedEx in a well-packaged box."

I bought the camera through Amazon fulfillment and it was sold to me as NEW. But when I got it and started going through the menus and customizing it, it was clear it had been used. It even had another person's name and email in the camera! I contacted Amazon, and all they could offer me was a return, and let's be honest, that's a major hassle and time consuming. And this is something I should not have to do! They sold me a misrepresented item, and now I have to spend my time fixing their mistake with zero compensation. I bought the camera for an overseas vacation we are taking and I needed time to get used to it before we go, and returning it eats into that time. I have a few days left to return it. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. It costs more to buy it locally, but I cannot ever trust Amazon again. I will never buy any electronics or expensive items from them again. Who knows how many used or returned items I have gotten in the past and didn't notice? The camera looks new, but who knows what it went through before I got it?

Now the camera itself. It is simply amazing. The photos I uploaded are SOOC, no post processing at all. The Nighttime parade was shot in very low light, handheld with a Zeiss Batis 85mm. The lizard was shot at the zoo, through glass, and the focus is absolutely spot on the eye. It was also low light conditions. It shoots night time scenes like they are shot during the day. I took shots of the canyon view from my house (24 mm Zeiss Batis) and the canyon is lit up like daylight, but you can see the stars in the sky. Absolutely amazing. Portraits of my kids are gorgeous. My teen told me that it makes everything look better than her eyes can see it. Took it to a theme park and the colors are incredibly vibrant, and the pictures are very sharp. I love the silent mode for capturing pics of the kids when they don't know they are being photographed. The camera is also light for carrying around. I bought a shoulder holster called a Skout from Cotton On, and while it looks a little nerdy it couldn't be more convenient or comfortable. By the way, all accessories I have bought were not bought from Amazon.

If you are hesitating about buying this camera, don't. It exceeds all my expectations. Just don't buy it from Amazon, or their subsidiary Adorama. Buy local."

This review is just me and an general overview of what I think about the camera. That being said.
Amazing camera. Will do just about everything you expect it to. Build is excellent with one minor exception if you are a perfectionist. The doors that cover the USB ports are slightly flimsy and I noticed that when I placed the camera on the table you could break off the door if you are not careful. That being said the battery life of the camera has much improved. I purchased a second battery but have yet to use it (spent a day at the Philadelphia Flower Show and 1 battery got me through the day.)
This is not a camera to use on automatic. If you love playing with different lighting schemes and layouts, taking portraits and taking tons of pictures and exploring different ways of taking pictures then you can't go wrong with this camera. If you want to spend a ton of money on a camera and use it on auto look at the Sony RX series. Video is also excellent and I have started using a lot more. I was always a still photographer but this camera has much more flexibility in the video area and if you vlog you won't be disappointed and I am an amateur videographer.
While I now have native Sony Lenses you can use other lenses from your collection just remember you will need adapters that may not work as well as the native lenses. Many companies are now jumping on board with this camera and you can find some great lenses for decent prices or you can go all out with the G-Master line.
I also like the bluetooth function of pairing with the phone to add location data. Helps out a lot when sorting by location. Transfer of photos to phone via wireless has improves as well if you like to get your photos out quickly.
Menu functions are still a little clunky to use but there are enough custom buttons on the phone that you can automate you favorite actions to quickly get a great shot.
The eye and face autofocus are amazing and when you try it you will not be disappointed.
If you don't want to spend the bucks on this camera you can check out the new A7m3 coming out this month. I don't need it but it is cheaper with the same bells and whistles mostly with less megapixel then the A7Rm3. I am waiting on the next firmware update to see what they can do with this series.
You can't go wrong with this camera in the bag however if you are a canon/Nikon lover don't sell all your equipment just add this to the pile with and adapter and you will do fine."

The Sony a7R III is no exception and is considered by many experts as the best all-around camera on the market right now. DxO Mark gives the sensor a perfect rating of 100, tying it with Nikon’s D850, and is only surpassed by the medium-format giants Pentax 645Z and Hasselblad X1D-50c (though each of these medium-format cameras have numerous short-comings such as a high price tag and limited lens line-up, plus they make for a poor travel camera given the very large lenses but that’s beside the point).

Sony’s a7R III is well-built, has a weather-sealed body for use in inclimate weather, operates very quickly with a nearly instant auto-focus, and is highly customizable from button operatioin to menu designation. There is almost nothing to dislike. The OLED electronic viewfinder is crystal-clear and superior to a standard viewfinder in every way from its live representation of active settings to focus zoom and focus peeking to esentially anything one would see on the live-view screen on the back of the camera. The button layout is intuitive and responsive to touch. Having a designated exposure compensation dial on the top right is handy, in addition to multiple other dials, all of which are customizable to your preferences.

The camera’s one shortcoming lies in its touch screen. Though a nice feature to have, when executed properly, this feature feels more of an after-thought than a practical feature. The touch screen is only for selecting focus but its responsiveness and usefulness is limited at best. Hopefully a future firmware update will improve upon this aspect and increase its capabilities, but as of right now it is more useful in advertising than in photo shoots.

As for the E-Mount lens lineup; more and more 3rd-party manufacturers are developing lenses for this new-ish Sony line, such as Zeiss, Sigma, and Rokinon; many of whom are doing so without sacrificing image quality. Native E-Mount lenses from Sony offer a wide range of quality and price. Any of the Sony lenses with the GM stamp are of the highest quality on the market; they are also their most expensive lenses. The ‘G’ line is also excellent though not of the superior quality of the G Master line. All standard Sony lesses, without either the G or GM designation, are not worthy of this camera and should be avoided. One cannot discuss E-mount lenses without mentioning the Sony Zeiss line. Through a multi-decade partnership Sony and German manufacturer Zeiss have created some truly excellent lenses, many of which are on par with, or surperior to, the Sony G Master line.

All-in-all you will not be disappointed."

The autofocus is very fast, the image quality is very great, and it's not too heavy and easy to travel with. I can go on with saying nothing but good things about this camera because it's that great, sony really hit this one out of the ballpark, and plan to keep this for much longer than I plan on at first. The A7R4 is also a great camera but I feel they didn't really update much except for the megapixels, sd card compatibility, and autofocus.

Highly recommend,2021-03-29,"I've bought this used from Amazon warehouse. The camera is mostly in pristine condition except there is an issue with the screen turning green at boot. I have decided to ignore it and kept the camera. I am not disappointed! It's an amazing piece of hardware, I have been using A6000 for over 5 yrs and switching to this body has been a huge upgrade.
The image quality is stunning, autofocus is great but the autofocus on the cheaper A7iii is a lot better if you shooting burst mode @10fps. The other concern was the low light performance compared to A7iii and to be honest..it doesn't matter. The A7iii once again is atleast 1 stop better than A7riii at high ISO but if you pair your A7Riii with a fast lens, it doesn't matter. I would say conservatively ISO 3200 will produce very good images.
Other the two drawbacks mentioned above this body will destroy any competition at it's price point if you can get it under 2000 usd used. The amount of detail specially for landscape photography at 42mgpxl is just stunning! You could also shoot super 35 mode and get a respectful 18mgpx images, the viewfinder is much superior than the A7iii. I would highly recommend this camera if you debating with any full frame camera under 2000 usd! Period. The only real competition are the canon r5 but you need to consider the price difference and cost of lens.
I am currently using sony G 24-105 f4 and sony G 20mm f1.8 and both of them are really good value for the price tag."

I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. First and foremost this is the best camera Sony has made to date. It solve nearly every problem I have with the A7rii. The A7rii is decent for video, and a great landscape, portrait, and product photo camera, but wasn't a great do it all camera as some would have you believe.

The A7riii's most powerful feature for hybrid shooters is the ability to set your custom keys to do one thing in photo modes, and another in video. When I first got the camera I was skeptical about its major benefits, but after using it to cover a couple live events most recently the NAMM Show, I couldn't imagine wanting to switch back to my A7rii.

It's battery life is significantly longer than even Sony say's. I didn't think I'd care about 10 fps, but even that has proved useful in a few cases. It's ability to focus in lower light has made life way easier. I don't think the auto focus system is that dramatic of an improvement until the light levels come down, or when tracking object moving towards and away from the camera.

But as per Sony tradition there are still quite a few menu issues, and not because they are complicated. I get frustrated because these camera inevitably have settings conflicts, sometimes for reasons that make no sense, and worse the camera isn't going to explain what the problem is, which makes the learning curve for this Swiss Army knife of cameras that much more complicated. Software and communication is where Sony still struggles.

Last thought if you find that you switch back and fourth from video and stills something like a 50/50 or 60/40 this is the best camera you can buy, if not I would recommend checking out an A6500 as a back up camera as you would have 90% of the features for a third the price."

Pepp,Sony A7R III is a Great High Resolution Camera!,2018-10-29,"I've been getting around in writing a review for this camera, but I'm having too much fun with it. I originally pre-ordered the Nikon Z7 camera, but after doing some research on FF Mirrorless camera the Sony A7 & A9 cameras caught my eye. Since I only had one nice lens from Nikon going over to the Sony Camera System wasn't a deal breaker financially and I might had stay with Nikon if I had more Nikon Lenses. I just like the fact that Sony is on the third generation of Mirrorless cameras and they seem committed to their cameras. From what I have read about the Nikon A6 & A7 are great cameras, but Nikon is on its first generation of Mirrorless cameras. That was the deciding factor of canceling the Nikon Z7 and going with the Sony A7R III.
I like a camera that has a lot of pixels, for I love post editing pictures. The more pixels the better when it comes to this, for I can crop and manipulate these pictures better. If I ever start making serious money then I will purchase either a Sony A9 or a Sony A7 III camera for my second body. That way I can capture wildlife or a sporting event better and still have a high enough resolution to boot.
One word advice is that if you purchase this camera from Amazon make sure it's the only thing you order (I'm talking camera gear) otherwise Amazon might package other stuff in with this order. Though I had problem with this in the past with a lens, I made sure to let Amazon know that they shouldn't be packing non-camera equipment in shipping packages to a customer."

now the prices have come down a. bit so a steal of an awesome FF Mirrorless camera - yes the Canon R5 beats it in few areas - then again the A7r3 is a bit older - but it is also under $2500 same with the Nikon Z7 II

Sony has a reputation for being a bit stingy on their battery size, but this camera has battery that lasts an entire day (at least for me, but I carry a spare battery just in case). The dual memory cards are a nice feature, I set my camera up to save RAW to card 1 and JPG to card 2. If one card should malfunction (rare but it does happen) I have a back up my images.

I take pictures nearly every day of subjects that range from wildlife to family snapshots. I bought this camera before I retired in order that I would have a really good device to use for as long as I am able to get about well enough to pursue the hobby. I mostly shoot still images because I find video post production stultifying.
The AF speed and accuracy of this camera is only tested to extremes when I shoot grandkid sporting events. ( soccer, baseball, basketball ) As long as I am meticulous about the settings (see Patrick Murphy-Racy on youtube for a full rundown) I get pictures that I am proud of. When it comes to wildlife in my backyard with the right lens the detail is fantastic. Cropping in is of little consequence when I am unable to get close enough.
I have little use for a touch screen due to my aversion to video. I keep it turned off since bumping the screen moves the AF point unpredictably therefore I can't give an accurate review of that feature."

At first I was a little apprehensive when switching from Nikon DSLR to a Mirrorless Sony. It is definitely different from using a DSLR and Nikon in general for that matter. I was so concerned about the learning curve at first. I honestly didn't need to be. I struggled at first with the color profiling on the Sony, but I just had to learn a new way t process my raws in post. After a few month, and plenty of practice, the Sony is now my go to over my Nikon D850 in a majority of situations. It is quicker and produces more track sharp and successful images in continuous shooting than my Nikon does. Overall, it was a leap definitely worth taking."

It is my first full frame camera, and my first Sony. I am using a Metabones adapter with my Canon lenses.

The technology in this camera is far above and beyond what was in my Canon (and what is in more updated Canons), it's hard to know where to start. They have clearly thought about what it is like to shoot in diverse conditions, and the menus and custom functions are truly mind boggling. Some of my favorites are the ability to keep shutter speed and aperture constant, but vary ISO automatically, within a predefined range. If you enjoy bracketing your photos, this is really handy.

I'm still learning all the ways this camera can augment my photography. One gripe I have is the battery. I don't get more than 5 or 6 hours of shooting on a charge. I will have to buy a battery grip and invest in extras."

I paired this with Sigma 24-70 2.8 Art Lens for Sony E mount. I also bought a Canon lens adapter to go with this. I'm thinking of returning this after shooting over 200 images. More pixel but not that sharp compared to my four years old Canon. Definitely I will not recommend if you already have a good collection of glasses from Canon or Nikon. If you just started out and don't wanted to deal with Canon or Nikon and you don't mind Sony clunky interface, wanted high pixel counts, then take a chance. It is reasonably priced, during holidays, that is all I can say. If you have used quality camera before this one will just be an ok, for the price."

There's not much to say that isn't already covered in the glowing reviews posted to every camera blog and site.

The new longer battery life is wonderful, I never needed my 2nd battery even after shooting all day. Love that they moved the video button to the top. The main con of course is Sony's confusing menu system, but having had Sony cameras before I'm used to that. I wish Sony would do a flip out LCD but that is minor for me.

I did try video mode at top quality with the Lexar Pro 2000X U3 card, and the camera didn't recognize it as a U3 card, so I couldn't use it yet and the card is going back.

My only gripe is with the available lenses. The good Sony lenses cost twice as much as the good lenses from other brands, and they don't come without their own issues. I'll be sticking with my current setup for now except I'll probably pick up a used Sony prime lens."

- I only ever used this camera as a webcam and once for a wedding.

- Now it no longer works at all - The only indicator I have is a red light that blinks twice slowly and three times quickly. No LED screen, I tried replacing multiple batteries, and no memory cards were used either.
* There is no mention of what this error message means in the user documentation
* When contacting Sony, they told me that my only option is to send it to a 3rd party company across the country and that it would cost $550 just for the initial inspection.

This is my first, and probably last Sony Camera because of the short warranty and terrible reliability. My first Nikon Camera, by comparison, has lasted me over 11 years and it still works perfectly well.

For now, it looks like my A7RIII will just be a paper weight because I'd rather just buy a new Nikon or Canon when an ""Initial Inspection"" costs over $500 and nobody will tell me what the error message means."

I've been using Sony mirrorless cameras for a number of years. This full-frame camera is somewhat larger than my previous two cameras, but the features and resolution make the small fraction of a pound, and the need to use a slightly larger carrying case well worth it.
The battery is larger and has a much greater capacity, so much less risk of running out of juice while touring and taking lots of photos.
Still a good idea to get a spare battery.

I find the camera slow, it’s is because i record to both SD cards simultaneously and one slot supports UHS-II cards and slot 2 is the slowest slot that only supports UHS-I cards. In the past I have had big issues with the Sony A7 loosing images so a backup is a must

"Canon EOS 90D [18-135 f3.5-5.6 is USM Lens] DSLR Camera, Wi-Fi Enabled, International Version - Black",4.7,130000.0,150000.0,362,0,92.0,Canon,Canon EOS 90D,7.62 x 13.97 x 10.41 cm; 600 Grams,1 Lithium Ion batteries required.

With the increased resolution, I especially like the performance with my 100-400 f4.5-5.6L IS II and my 70-200 f2.8L IS, as well as my other lenses, such as the 18-135 USM that I bought to use as a general walk-around lens. I use the fold-out, live viewing screen with smaller zooms, but also with my faster fixed lenses; which makes street photography much more versatile. I recall photographing the Cuna Indians in Panama in the late 60s. At that time they believed that the camera would steal their soul, so the would turn away or cover their faces. Sneaky me, I would set the mechanical timers on my Pentax Spotmatics, which were totally manual SLRs, and secretly shoot photos while the cameras with fast fixed lenses hung from my neck, while my hands were obviously nowhere near the camera. Click! Got it. Hah! So now I am adding the 90d's fold-out optical live view screen, in order hold the camera away from my face, and this photographer seems more innocuous. Of course there's more....such as video, which will eventually get around to using... More, also, since I still haven't had this little gem that long.

Looking back at the progress both of SLR and DSLR cameras; Film cameras, then earlier digitals, both full frame 5d series and the APSC 7d and 7d MKII. I am comparing some of my previous film cameras and their capabilities and versatility - and the resulting images - comparing with the Canon A2, and the A1, and the earlier Pentax Spotmatics I've had. Viewing comparatively, it's easy to see that the 90d is not a toy.

Yep, this 90d is is not full frame, but so what? Looking at the results vs the price, comparing those facets with previous film cameras and full size sensor digitals. The 90d is not overly expensive, and some people scoff at what they're calling non-professional. But in my case, with multiple decades of experience, it does produce professional results.
I have photo-gadget freak and pretentious wanna-be friends who've dumped multiple tens of thousands of $$ into their photography pass times, calling themselves professional this or that, bragging about top of the line this or that computer or photo equipment, much of which changes with the edition of each of the next new releases. Yet 98.5% of them have never made enough income with their ""art"" to even pay for a fraction of their photo and computer equipment.
Yeah, the proof is in the taste of the pudding.
As always, we need to see the finished products and those which is good enough to be hanging on any wall,
anywhere, and whether observers stop long enough to give it a good look, let alone even study it.
All of that, in defense of an inexpensive DSLR camera which does pretty well, and can & does yield ""professional,""
not merely trivialized ""enthusiast"" results.

Gripes would be:
1) That this 90d would be nice - for my own taste - if it were to be encased in a heavier, titanium alloy body, such as those that people refer to as more of a professional camera, like the 7d, versus an ""enthusiast"" camera, because of the weather proofing, etc. I would actually prefer a Mark III, in the 7d line, which I was waiting for, but apparently the 90d is IT; no more of the Canon 7d line. So I bought one and am satisfied with its performance.

2) The little whiz wheel in back, seems a bit small. But, that does also have a fast forward and back button in the middle of it.

3) And, whatever Gordon Laing has come up with; among all of the pros and cons of his thorough and snappy 90d review on YouTube."

This new model shines! Takes great photos and video's as well. The 18-135 lens will make a great everyday carry around lens and the best thing is, all my older lenses and equipment will fit perfectly, no adapters needed! This is the top of the line, the pinnacle of Canon's DSLR line. The best there is IMHO."

It does everything as advertised. However, stay away from the kit lens Zoom 18-135mm. The picture quality is OK. Not the greatest, but the zoom ring on the lens I got is very stiff. If you plan to do a smooth zoom while shooting video, you will never get it. The lens is meant to be used with the Canon Power Zoom Adapter PZ-E1 which has been discontinued and is hard to find. The menu system is great. Autofocus is quick and quiet. The camera is very responsive even while using my older autofocus lens. Not sure how long Canon will continue marketing the 90D or any additional DSLRs, but this one is a winner."

I haven't tried the video mode for more than 10 minutes. Looks good, but definitely use a reliable tripod. Or some sort of gimble. The lense I used was an older one with no stabilization. I also didn't use all of the video settings im the menu. I'm still learning.

Overall, an expensive worthwhile purchase. The lense that comes in this kit is really really good too.

HOWEVER, sadly I found the camera package was not sealed, which was supposed to be so. What made me more disappointed is the main dial, which was stiff and but what made me even more dumbfounded is the camera lens, which might have been manufactured, hopefully not designed, for utilization of a wrench to make it turn. As every time I turned the lens manually (I was using the manual mode and had turned it to MF), I had an issue of turning it smoothly, in a soft fashion, the failure of which resulted in a shake of the camera. I've given the camera two stars for its delivery, but not the camera set. I'm definitely going to return it soon!

As we've bought Canon before, it works pretty well. I'm going to purchase another Canon 90D, and I wish the forthcoming new purchase would be without issues. Otherwise, I'm going to turn to other brands such as Sony and Olympus, both of which were purchased years ago and have been working amazingly well.

I'm going to leave my review for the new purchase after it's arrived and has been tested."

Quick and easy to use, the 90D is a great recreational camera; a little on the bulky side, but I have been known to be a tad hard on equipment, so could end up being a better bet than the R6.

You definately should buy a second battery and if you are going to get a case take the camera to a store to see what fits and keep in mind you will end up buying another lens so the case should hold two.

Camera works, Lens is amazing. I want my grip...
Edit: 14 May 2020.
This “bundle” is no deal, and quite the misleading ad.
This does not come with the battery grip, even though it is shown for no reason. This bundle is also listed almost $600 higher than in the Canon USA site, and you get the exact same equipment.
This is obviously my own fault for not seeing that it wasn’t listed...nor do they have a product description informing of the full contents of this package.
I quite literally spent about $700 more than I needed, and will be returning this item as to purchase a bundle that comes with what is advertised."

Wang,The megapixels are worth it!,2021-07-08,"I have owned every A7r camera including the original, A7rii, A7riii, and now the A7riv. The A7riv is the first big image quality improvement in years! Is it worth it to upgrade to 60MP? Definitely but be aware that this still a specialized camera and not an action camera.

The camera industry remained stead at the 24MP range for years now. In the past year the Canon R5 and R6 cameras have pushed the envelope and the new megapixel race is back in full swing. Usually high megapixel wars were more about bragging rights and marketing than actual usability. Noise and image quality decreases with higher resolutions due to smaller physical pixels. This remains true with the A7riv's 60MP sensor over the A7riii's 42MP. However the increased resolution minimalizes the perceivable noise increase (You won't see it unless you pixel peep). In addition, the higher resolution helps with sharpness, contrast, and cropping flexibility across the board and you get an overall better camera.

The Good:

Image Quality. As mentioned above 60MP improves sharpness and cropping flexibility. There is some degradation of dynamic range and noisier ISOs. But again, since the resolution is much finer, the small amounts of noise introduced is much less noticeable at these resolutions. When used with uncompressed RAW (see below) you get much better ISO and dynamic range.

Cropping. I cannot emphasize the ability to crop with 60MP. The larger megapixel count gives greater range of flexibility to crop, refocus, and recompose photos in post. Often I change the entire composition of a photo with extreme cropping of my A7riv files. You can change full body portraits into headshots and retain excellent sharpness. Reframe centered subjects to align with rule of thirds or vice versa. The ability recompose shots afterwards is amazing!

Autofocus. The A7riv has a significantly improved AF that covers much more of the sensor than the A7riii. The A7riii just added a few more contrast detection points over the A7rii but the A7riv has PDAF points nearly covering the entire sensor. With my A7riii it was very difficult to eye-AF on subjects on the corners of the sensor. With the A7riv, unless your subject is on the very edge of the sensor, you will have full AF functionality including eye-AF. Furthermore the AF is much snappier and eye-AF finds the eye faster and stays locked on in dimmer conditions and further away than the A7riii.

Battery. The camera still uses the newer Z batteries that comes with the newer generation of Sony cameras. The Z Batteries have doubled life over the older W batteries. Getting such a long runtime with such a high MP camera is pretty great.

IBIS stabilization. Sony was one of the first large companies to use IBIS in full frame cameras. 5.5 stops of stabilization is amazing and still makes handheld slow light photos seem like they were on a tripod. I am still amazed by this feature sometimes. Tests do show that in real world tests the A7riv has slightly better IBIS stabilization than the A7riii.

Ergonomics/usability: Not much has changed over the A7riii. Every year, each new version of the camera is bigger, thicker, and heavier. The joystick feels nicer and the shape is more comfortable. The camera itself is slightly thicker which is better to hold for your hands. There are no glaring issues here.

The bad:

Dynamic Range. Dynamic range is on par with other cameras of this generation. However shadow recovery is slightly worse than the A7riii. This is mainly due to the use of Compressed RAW setting with continuous shooting. When using Compressed Raw and continuous/burst mode, the camera shoots at 12-bit instead of 14 bit. If you shoot in single shots with uncompressed RAW you can get much better dynamic range and shadow recovery. 60Mp files are huge and not easy to process and this camera is NOT an action camera. But the fact that you can get 10fps with a 60mp camera even at 12-bit is still pretty amazing.

Processing speed: With 60MP, writing to SD cards is even slower than before. As previously mentioned you can improve image quality by using uncompressed raw which DOUBLES file sizes from around 59mb to around 117mb. This makes writing to a regular 90/95mb/s USH-I card EVEN SLOWER. You can't review images after each shot without waiting for the writing to clear. With continuous multiple shots it takes EVEN SLOWER! You can help alleviate this problem with faster UHS-II 300mb/s cards but at the time of this review these cards are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. Sony really needs to implement compressed lossless RAW files as 60MP is nearing the limit and resolution will continue to creep up.

Speed. This is not an action or sports camera, but it CAN handle some action at 10fps. As mentioned previously, shooting in burst and continuous does reduce quality a bit. If you are a wedding photographer or lifestyle/street photographer this will be fine for your needs. However if you are shooting sports, dance, motion, a dedicated action sports camera that can handle the speed without quality loss like the A1 or A9 would be better suited for you.

Pixel shift. Pixel shift is a great feature on paper. The sensor shifts very slightly letting you get significantly better quality images by using quadrupling the color information in each pixel. However realistically you can't use it without some smearing or ghosting. Unless you are using it for perfectly static scenes you will get some sort of smearing. Wind moving tree leaves or grass, moving cars in cityscapes, any movement will throw off the sensor. I have never meaningfully used this feature. Additionally you need Sony's Edge software to compile the images which just adds to the processing steps.

This is a great camera and a phenomenal upgrade. It does however have some limitations. For years the A7r series was the flagship camera of Sony's line. However we must remember this is really geared for landscapes and studio work were lighting conditions are controlled and you don't need to shoot fast action. Sony has diversified with the A9 and A1 line with the A9 being sports and the A1 being the dedicated all-around flagship camera with little compromises. For your everyday photographer who is not shooting ballet dancers or basketball games regularly, this should be perfectly suitable for their needs. Even professional wedding and street photographers will find little to complain about. Only the most demanding action photographers pushing the limits will want more."

I loved the A7R II for the amazing sensor vast improvement on autofocus and play memories app. But I was frustrated with battery life.
The A7R III corrected the battery life with a huge leap forward in Stamina. The new battery is still the best in mirrorless cameras. The 3rd generation also improved ergonomics, button placement, etc while using the same sensor as the previous generation. The A7R III is an amazing camera and truly refined. The only thing negative was slow sensor readout that resulted in banding when using silent shooting or electronic shutter. You could also see it in videos. But this sensor was still better than anything out there.

Unfortunately Sony decided to participate or precipitate the megapixel war for the 4th generation (A7R IV).
This means compromising in terms of noise, iso sensitivity and slower sensor readout. The A7R IV sensor readout is 50% slower than the A7R III and has more noise than that of the A7R III at similar iso.

But they did refine the body by changing the buttons size, putting a much needed lock on the aperture compensation and increasing the grip.
Here’s my opinion on the changes to the body:
1. I actually prefer the grip of the A7R III but in time I am sure I will adjust to the new one.
2. The buttons while larger, feel mushy when pressing it. This is a step backwards.
3. I really like the lock on the exposure compensation dial, as I would inadvertently turn the dial on the A7R III.
4. I prefer the lock mechanism of the older memory door, but the new one seems more weather sealed.
5. I prefer the new port doors to the older one.
6. I am hoping that there is really improved weather sealing here. Photography is not just a fair weather art.

Other features:
1. Same old video codec and still only 8 bit. But I like that the recording time limit is removed. So a positive.
2. Improved menu options (autofocus color options, other customization)
3. Supposed to have real time tracking. But I noticed the my A7R III was faster and a bit more accurate overall. Hopefully future firmware will improve it.
4. I have to admit that the 50% increase in resolution does give incredible detail. But this comes with a greater possibility of blur. You have to be extremely careful with your shutter speeds and techniques to prevent shutter shock.
5. Unfortunately Sony has been extremely short sighted when designing a high megapixel sensor, by not programming in lossless compressed raw files. In addition smaller raw files with lower resolution are not options. This actually makes me feel that this camera was a rush to market to demonstrate technological capabilities.
6. They have not fixed or improved the speed of the buffer writing to the sd cards. Another callous decision considering the amount of data needed to be written with 61MP. This makes the camera unusable when writing from buffer same as in the Mark III.

I think Sony missed out on refining the camera and making it a big leap forward.
So, why did I buy this camera? I actually purchased it to augment my A7R III and not replace it, for the following features:
1. No more recording limit on 4K, so I can record long classical concerts.
2. New digital interface for audio
3. Possibility of using the SAL 135mm 1.8 A-mount lens with this camera, using the soon to be released LA-EA5 adapter. This is my favorite lens and I prefer it to the e-mount GM lens. This was the biggest reason I bought this camera.
4. Price: Sony reduced the price by $500 for the amazon prime day sale.

So, in the week I have had it, I can say it is a solid camera.
I hope Sony will make improvements with firmware as they did with the Mark III.
I feel that this is much more of a specialist camera than the A7R III due to the big increase in resolution.
If you are looking for a better all round camera with high resolution, I would go for the A7R III.

For those that want an excellent all round camera, the A7 III is still the one to beat. I hope that Sony takes a lot more care when designing its successor (A7 IV).

Note: I did find the perfect Arca Swiss plate for this camera and all the other A9, A9 II, A7R III, A7 III, etc - the Arca-Swiss 802225. It’s a little pricy, but let’s you clamp the camera on its horizontal axis, thus letting you use larger adapters, lenses, etc without any obstruction. It’s also designed to not twist.
I use it on all my Sony cameras.
The best wrist straps that I use is Gordy’s camera wrist strap."

I am so glad I brought the A7riv with me. I was able to take some amazing pics of the dolphins from far away using the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 and then crop in. The focus tracking works amazingly well as well. Noise is definitely worst then the A7iii in low light situation. But I am willing to live with that with all the other amazing features of the A7Riv.

But do you?,2019-10-28,"The A7R4 isn't for everyone, but if your niche meets the needs of high resolution and mirrorless performance, it is fantastic.

Combined with the Sony 90mm Macro I can attain tac sharp focus handheld on insect eyes. I can shoot tiny jumping spiders, assassin bugs, flowers, lichen, moss, and all kinds of incredibly tiny subjects. APSC mode (or crop in Lightroom) makes this both the highest resolution Full Frame as well as a phenomenal Crop Sensor camera. Win win!

Combined with Sony 24-70 F2.8 GM, I can shoot all of my day-to-day non-macro photos. Things like street photography, infant photography, family photos, and more.

If dual memory card slots is critical to you, then this is a feature you need and will love. Most mirrorless cameras (ie Nikon) are a dang joke! So sad! Seriously, if you don't have dual cards in the camera then it is just a toy, not a tool. Professionals can't risk loosing photos.

File size is huge, managing space might be hard, a fast computer will help in processing and managing your files. Google drive doesn't support Sony RAW files, so I also save jpg versions for quick viewing. More space gone... more upload time required.

The app is actually really great for a newer app. Connecting works all the time, but only if you do things in a particular order. They should fix that... I can control my exposure triangle from the app, shoot, and review a low resolution sample. Great for a remote shutter. Doesnt let me touch to focus... would love remote focus with focus magnifier. Would die for the same with a focus stacking mode from the app. I might be a dreamer though, probably won't ever see this.

Ok, and the back screen. Seriously Sony?! Still poor resolution, but the biggest sin is that the screen still doesn't flip around like canon cameras! Holy smokes, catch a clue Sony! Vloggers are a huge deal, stop ignoring them! At least the app can give you a remote live view experience on your cell phone. So that seems to be a workaround for me. But I can see that not working well for people that blog a lot.

Most people could do well with an A7R3 instead. Could you benefit from the savings? Could you use that for more accessories or glass? Would that help you more than the resolution jump? Maybe!

For macro, the super high resolution is really a big help. Know your needs!

Hope this helps you decide on your next camera! I love my Sony A7R4!"

I've not used the A9 II but easily better than the 1DX II or D5. Shocked at how good the AF was in all cases. The picture quality is a different story not impressed at all. At 1 to 1 it doesn't compare to a GFX 100 or even GFX 50 for that matter. It's saving grace is you can apply heavy amounts of noise reduction and it will still be pretty detailed for web use. If you're buying this and thinking you're going getting amazing image quality I'd say look elsewhere. The A7R III, D850, Panasonic S1R, all make nicer images. Any detail gains are not worth the overall reduction in image quality, mainly unpleasant noise. It may not have helped that lately I've also been using the X-T3 and while not as detailed the colors are amazing as soon as I open the raws in Capture One. The A7R IV files not so much. Specifically when you have shots from same shoot on different cameras and can compare the images side by side. Wish the A7III or A7R III had the focusing system of the A7R IV. That is really the special feature that sets this camera apart, not the 60 megapixels or the image quality.

A7R4 Its not good for low light, * if you have an Prime lens 1.4 you will have great shots!
With Lens 2.8 you will see some or much grainy on your photos.. but up to 6000 iso its pretty good!
The sensor is 61mp, so thats why there is a lot noise!
But to the other site a A9ii its for the professional users.. I can take 12.000 and 15.000 ISO and some noise!
Perfect for low light photojournalism and sports !
So I love both.. but A9ii its better in Autofoco, low light and things are more reliable to do... wedding etc etc!
A7R4 its the second for Sony Alpha cameras that offer you a great Autofoco but A9ii is a little more advanced for the autofoco and low light situations!
Let me know What you think! Love both and if you can afford it.. buy both!"

It's not just the additional 10 mp you get with the a7riv, it's also the superior quality of Sony's lenses, the superior dynamic range of the sensors, and the amazing Sony focal systems. I've shot everything from landscapes to sports to fashion with my iv. It never disappoints and routinely amazes---detail and tonal contrast is better than anything I've ever used before. With the Sony 70-200 mm G lens, the iv does a superlative job at just about everything. My Canon bodies and lenses are now a back up system. There's a steep learning curve with the iv, and of course, the raw files are huge and cumbersome, but it's all worth if if image quality is your goal."

Friesz,Unexpected Surprise,2020-01-29,"Th ergonomics of this camera compared to the previous 7r models are very user friendly. The increased backbutton size, the larger grip and just the way the camera feels in your hand are welcomed improvements. The fast focus, focus tracking and focus point color are also worthy of praise. However, the need for Gmaster lenses to really see a difference in image quality were not apparent to me before I purchased the A7riv. Spending $3500 for the same picture quality as a 7riii with the same lenses for $1000+ less makes little sense unless you are willing to spend $1500 to $2500 for premium glass. Also unless you have the need to print huge sized images, why do you need 60 megapixels of resolution. In fact uncompressed images are over 120Mb and will eat up most hard drives. 42 megapixels of resolution produces incredible sharpness with almost all Sony native glass including Tamron and Sigma Art (Sony) lenses. and if you shoot 10 frames per second you have to wait for buffer to slowly clear before you can change any settings, maybe resulting in lost shots. If you are a professional photographer (I doubt any will read reviews on Amazon) and you need larger prints than say 30x40, what is the point of higher resolution sensors? I have been shooting with a A7riii for a couple of days after returning my IV and I am amazed at the quality of the images I am getting with a Sony 24-105 f4, a Tamrom 17-28 and a Sony 50 f1.8. Spend the extra money if you feel the need, but I doubt you will see any improvement for general photography. Save the $1000 and buy more lenses for your A7riii which I highly suggest you try before considering the A7riv."

A bit disappointed to see little work done on the camera's menu structure. The camera offers 14-bit uncompressed Raw or compressed Raws that use Sony's potentially destructive compression. There's still no lossless or visually lossless compression option.

There is no 4K/60p on the a7R IV but the camera remains a strictly 8-bit video camera. Most rivals now offer 10-bit capture or output: something that gives a significant boost in terms of editing flexibility to Log footage, so it's odd not to see it here.

Rather than resolving existing quirks and foibles, Sony is more focused on adding attention-grabbing new features and, to be fair, Full-time Eye AF / Full-time Tracking are very impressive."

Noise :
- noisier than A7R3 and A73 so not great for taking pictures of my kids inside with only ambient lightning
- A7R4 is about 1/3 stop noisier than A7R3 which means, to have as little noise, you need to let enter 1/3 stop more light
- which means you need to lower your shutter speed (or increase aperture) by 1/3 stop, for example from f/250 to f/160, which means you will have more difficulty freezing action so your image have chances to be blurrier

File size :
- uncompressed raw files are huge (120mb)
- there is no lossless raw compression
- you will a fast computer ($$) and a lot of SSD space to process these files
- you will need large fast SD cards (UHS-II, U3, at least 256GB) that are expensive ($$)
- even Sony SF-M sd card is relatively slow and won't allow me to quickly see my photos to review focus for example, I have to wait for the buffer to clear, else it's laggy, which is quite annoying, I will have to try Sony SF-G
- Canon r5, Sony a7rIII, a7s3 files are much smaller so they are faster to process, think about it since your time is valuable

Complexity :
- not much is simple with this camera
- menus could be worst but they are not user friendly at all
- a ""slow"" SD card makes shooting in continuous mode quite annoying/odd/slow, Sony should warn the user
- no scene selection mode like on my Canon 6D for people that want or need simplicity (I don't trust full auto mode)
- saved settings for memory recalls can't be renamed to meaningful description
- touch tracking not enabled by default
- limited touch screen functionalities (only useful to set tracking point basically)
- enabling Preview makes Continuous Mode atrocious because the Preview also appears in the Viewfinder
- to zoom a Sony lens, it's the inverse direction than on the Canon (might be Canon's fault)
- would be nice if Sony gave recommended settings (some kind of pre-sets/suggestions for Custom Keys/Buttons and My Menu Favorites)
- no automatic focus bracketing
- PlayMemories software keeps creating .modd files and importing my PC pictures in its library even if I unselected all folders from being imported.

I tried the feature ""View on TV"", I get ""could not authenticate the connection"" on the camera and Registration failed on my sony TV (xbr 65x900e). I tried multiple times. Then I tried connecting by entering the password, I got ""could not find the access point"".

Then I tried the new app for ios devices called Visual Story. First, why not on android ? This is not very respectful of android users. Second, it was not available in Canada. Third, (once I changed my country in apple store) the process to set it up is a mess, the ipad does not see the camera when trying to connect via bluetooth to set up the FTP and I tried with multiple ipads.

Update after a few months : I got used to its many flaws and I was able to get good results without too much trouble. But this does not make it a better product. Another missing opportunity : there is no way to see the focus points using Sony Imaging Edge. Let's say you want to check where your focus was to better understand the end result. Finally, for video, the image stabilization is disappointing. My phone and my gopro are miles better and both are less expensive. Now Sony released the A1, double the price of the R4 and they have not updated the firmware on the R4 since over 6 months, pretty disappointing, not sure I will buy another camera from Sony because I don't want to encourage Sony to release more expensive products instead of improving flawed products already released.

Any pros ? Ok cropping when you have images of that size/resolution is pretty insane (as long as you have low iso and no motion blur), dual slot is always good to have, dynamic range is good, battery life is ok and it survived to Canadian winters."

The camera does not focus properly. Misses more than 80% of the shots taken. Doesn't matter ISO, shutter speed, aperture, lens, eye tracking, spot focus, tripod, etc: for almost all the pictures, the camera misses focus. Even though it's much slower at auto focus, my Sony A7R performs better.

UPDATE: Changing to 3 stars: I have received a replacement A7R IV and the focus issues are gone. There is a real issue with this model not focusing for some units. Check out dpreview or other forums. If you have an issue with your unit, get it replaced!"

I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.

This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.

It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is ""open"" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)

It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.

Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The ""mixed"" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)

The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.

There are a bunch of ""creative"" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.

The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable ""quick menu"", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.

Drawbacks I've noticed:

You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.

It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.

I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far."

She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.

Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion

She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , ""I love this camera"", . ""I love this camera"". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail. I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.

Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special

1. The camera has an excellent grip, it feels good in the hands. Easy to use.
2. Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200
3. Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!
4. Great zoom range. From 25 to 600
5. EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better
6. Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera
7. Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.
8. Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light
9. Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums
10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?
11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD
12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.
13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.
14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.
15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise
16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.
17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters
18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter
19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.
20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.
21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.
22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.
23. Good quality macro images possible.

What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.

1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited
2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.
3. Could use a headphone jack for video.
4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.
5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.
6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.
7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.
8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.

If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you, consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300.."

Overall, I think the camera is great, both at shooting photos as well as videos. No camera is perfect, but I've found very few faults for the type of shooting I do.

Autofocus: The FZ300 uses contrast detect autofocus, with a feature called Depth From Defocus (DFD). DFD can know how far focus is off when you press the shutter, and in which direction to go to get it perfect. This means that autofocus is very good, and especially very fast. It really snaps into focus with no hunting. It can also use the whole sensor to focus, instead of just a reduced number of areas. It is said that phase detect, used by other manufacturers is better for video, but I've found the contrast detect with DFD just fine.

Lens: the lens has an 35mm equivalent of 25mm to 600mm, which means it goes from quite wide angle to long telephoto. What is spectacular is that it covers this whole range with an aperture of f/2.8, which is rare. So the lens lets in more light than many other cameras of this type. After working with this lens, I would never go back to a camera with interchangeable lenses. I have all I need right now, without the hassle of changing lenses.

Sensor: the sensor is small at 1/2.3"", which can translate to bad low light capability. The FZ300 compensates with the large aperture, and an image processing engine (called Venus) which does a good job of reducing the noise when there is some present. The advantage of a small sensor is increased depth of field, which makes focusing a lot easier.

A few nice features:
- The camera is weather sealed, which protects it from dust and water. Don't use it for underwater photography though, as it isn't designed for it and would certainly not survive.
- The swivel screen lets you shoot from up high, or from low to the ground. Once you use one, you'll never want to be without it.
- The viewfinder, which you don't have on some other cameras, or smartphones, is nice for shooting in bright light, like on a sunny day, where the screen is hard to see.
- It has a built-in flash. It isn't as powerful as a dedicated flash on a hotshoe, but still does a good job and is always there when you need it.
- It can shoot in both raw and jpeg, or just one of them if you wish."

I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for ""snaps"" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones. Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.

I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.

Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it. With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video. What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.

Pros:
Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps
Plenty of ""creative"" modes
Full Manual control for advanced amateurs
Fast f2.8 glass
4K video, Photo modes
TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.
Image stabilization

Cons:
12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size
24mm isn't very wide angle
Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)
High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)
Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)

Overall:

Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses. If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.

The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances ""in the wild"" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.

My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.

I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...

In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.

The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3"" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1"" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.

That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me."

As you can see it still takes great pictures. I just snapped this picture this morning. When I first purchased this camera everything worked fine out of the box.
Now here are the problems four years later. First the zoom adjustment started glitching after two years. Although it still narrowly works at the shutter button position. I now use the zoom adjustment positioned on the lense which works fine. The screen display after three years blacks out intermittently. I have to move the camera around and the display screen comes back on. The screen tap to target your focal point blacks out the screen instantaneously. So it's almost impossible to find where your focus box is in the display screen.
At this point I would say you get what you pay for at a price point of $400.

It's just unfortunate as this camera does take very good pictures when it works."

It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100. When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of."

Milligan,Outstanding for 4K video and time lapses,2019-08-11,"One of my hobbies is time lapse photography, and I've used many cameras (and many smartphone apps) towards that end. This camera produces not only some fantastic results, but it's super easy to use for that purpose. Exposure between frames in a time lapse is nice and steady, there's hardly any exposure flicker at all, even when doing a night-to-day time lapse. On auto-ISO, exposure can adjust itself in one-unit increments, so you don't get a sudden jump in exposure when it moves from ISO 100 to ISO 200 for example, it'll go 100, 101, 102, as needed. The time lapse interval is continuously adjustable in seconds, so you don't have to choose between 2 sec and 5 sec intervals when you actually want 3 sec, like you do with, say, a popular action camera. It has the ability to pause and resume a time lapse, and you can change settings, reframe, and even zoom in the middle. Color and contrast are pretty true to life, and adjustable in-camera.

4K video is excellent, especially in good light. The exposure metering does a really good job, and the Creative Video mode lets you set part or all of the exposure triangle manually, effectively giving you aperture-priority and shutter-priority modes for video. Point and shoots and phones usually use way too fast a shutter speed for video--this camera can do 1/25 exposures at 24 fps, giving that nice smooth motion that makes a video look like it was shot on a real camera.

The lens is fairly fast at f/2.8, and it maintains that throughout its zoom range. The body is weather-sealed and I've used it in the rain many times without any fogging up. The battery, when new, lasts for a few hours of photos or about 1.5 hours of video, and you can easily get a DC adapter to hook it up to external power if you need more than that.

There are a few shortcomings, but they're not dealbreakers for me: video is limited to 30 minutes (which is annoying and unnecessary), and time lapses to 9,999 photos (at a 1 second interval that's about 2h45m). The manual focus wheel only starts moving after you've turned it about 1/16 turn, and requires some fiddling at times. And of course with its small sensor, it starts to get pretty grainy at high ISOs, limiting its use in very low light.

Overall, an amazing camera for the price and perfect for time lapse photographers and daytime amateur videographers."

It has amazing zoom capabilities, but in order to produce this feature in a small compact lens system, the sensor had to be small as well. Most bridge cameras have this same shortcoming, but Panasonic did the sensible thing and limited resolution to 12 megapixels, which contrary to marketing campaigns, is quite enough for most purposes. Small sensors have poor low light performance universally, but taking a small sensor up to 16 or 20 megapixels might give more detail, but also much more noise, so when you post process, the extra detail gets washed out with the noise in the noise reduction steps. The FZ300 has somewhat better high ISO performance then other bridge cameras with small sensors because of this design choice. I have enclosed two bird pictures, the cardinal was heavily cropped and enlarged, so the grass is very noisy, a field of green pixels. The Sparrow is a full image at full zoom, not cropped and noise is very minimal, not visible. When handled correctly, and run carefully with ISO's no higher than 400, the camera does a good job and as already noted has amazing zoom capability. The software in the camera is very clever giving many custom options to take advantage of the systems strengths and working around the weaknesses of small sensor exposure. This is my second camera after my Nikon D3500, and though the FZ300 can't outclass the Nikon in picture quality due to sensor limitations, it also can do some things my Nikon can't do. The two are complimentary. The camera has a 'point and shoot' mode for beginning photographers, but you can also shoot raw, and do intense processing if you so wish to. Highly technical people will love this camera for it's unique character and capabilities. I down rated the autofocus slightly, it's not bad, works well most of the time, but the small sensor issues in low light will occasionally cause a little retrying action. Comes with the territory, not a failing in the machine."

I have the Canon T5i with a 100-400mm lens which weighs several pounds and looks like a white telescope which makes everyone look at me. Sometimes you just don't want that kind of attention, nor to have to carry an item using a huge backpack. This camera is much lighter, fits in my purse, and wearing it with a neck strap for hours doesn't fatigue me like the DSLR did. I'm amazingly impressed with the video quality, I took a video of a butterfly fluttering around a flower and it looks like professional movie quality, better than my Canon even. I like the way this Panasonic handles auto focus, colors seem spot-on, and pictures come out sharp. This has cut down on my correction of color balance and sharpening in photoshop afterwards. I tried the previous version fz200 of this camera first, as well as a Canon Powershhot sx720, but wasn't as happy with the image quality compared to this fz300 for the similar price point of under 500. The video on this camera blows all others out of the water, I'd even go so far to say this price was worth it as a video camera/camcorder replacement alone.

In low light conditions this camera seems to do best with flash, I did see some grainy images in shady room light, but every camera I've ever owned suffers from that. In well lit situations I've never seen a non DSLR produce such high quality images though, and this was a quarter of the price I paid for my canon with lens. When I zoomed in on a bush I got a clear shot of a bee where you can even see the pollen particles on the bee. I zoomed on a tree about 100 feet away and could see the small birds on it (see photos). I was also surprised to see a bokeh effect on the background of a flower I had zoomed in on, the background was a parking lot which was very unnatractive, but you can't even see it because it made the flower in focus and soft blurred the background for me. This is a effect commonly seen in DSLR cameras, but I wasn't aware this would be capable of that.

I found the camera very easy to operate, fit my hands well, had plenty of options usually only found on higher end cameras such as manual focus, and the touch-screen turns off when you press your face against the eye viewfinder (which has a sensor to detect your face, or when you have the camera just resting on your chest with the strap) which saves you battery power. My main purpose of buying this camera is to capture wildlife shots when I'm out of the house, but not planning to do photography so the DSLR is at home. This fitting in my purse and being lightweight, I take it with me everywhere to avoid those ""I wish I had my camera with me"" moments."

(I serve the construction market.) Enthusiast-level cameras do a great job and this one cost a fraction of what I spent on my last lens. While many clients are content with the photos they get from their iPhones, that's not what I want to deliver. In order to provide the quality I believe differentiates my services I need the control of a DSLR but I want the the compact size, low cost, and light weight of a great point-and-shoot.Here's what I love about this camera:
>The ability to shoot shutter priority, aperture priority, full manual, or full auto (with consistently good results in auto)
>Fast, quiet autofocus and zoom
>Tilt and swivel touch-screen monitor
>Very good 4k video
>A decent built-in, variable-output flash and a hotshoe
>The ability to shoot RAW
>A decent built-in mic and a jack (the sound quality is very good with the built-in mic although production audio rarely makes it to the finish)
>Quick cold starts and near-zero latency on the shutter
The only thing I truly dislike is the thumbwheel focus. It's slow, badly placed, makes pull focus and follow focus nearly impossible (although the auto follow focus does a good job), and after a half-century of shooting I can't stop reaching for the barrel of the lens.
I also wish they'd allocated costs differently. For some reason makers of enthusiast-level cameras think they need to pack their products with features that I find useless. Maybe their market demands these gimmicks but I hate 'em. Scene modes. Color balance. Drive modes. Then they slather on buttons and menus so that, in theory, you can access and manipulate all these options. I find them a hindrance. I wish they'd spent their money on a faster lens, a larger sensor, and better dynamic range. Overall I like this camera a lot and it will serve my commercial and personal needs very well. But it could be better, much better, with fewer frills. I've included some images from when I was first playing with the camera. The food shot from Patti's 1880s Settlement in Grand Rivers KY was shot at f2.8, 1/50, ISO 3200, no flash, in Intelligent Auto. The shot of Cave Run Lake (KY) was at f4, 1/320, ISO 100, Intelligent Auto. The picture of the church in downtown Kingsport, TN was shot at f2.8, 1/20, ISO 4000 in Intelligent Auto."

I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!
There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers!

This camera has officially become one of my go to cameras for work and for fun. I normally use a Pentax K-50 or Sony Nex 5n. When traveling, I use a Sony HX90v and RX100m3. I found this camera while looking for 4K capable cameras to use for my YouTube channel. As you can see, I was mainly a hardcore Sony fan, but this camera persuaded me to try another brand. Thankful that I did. It has close to the zoom that the Sony HX90v has. Fully zoomed the HX90v has around ~700mm reach (35mm equivalent) and this camera is about ~600mm reach. 100mm isn't much from my experience to truly make a huge difference. One thing that this camera has that I love about it, that the HX90v doesn't have. Is the ability to shoot RAW files. Which is something I can get from my RX100m3 and my DSLR/Mirrorless. Now, this isn't going to beat the image quality that the RX100m3 or K50/5n give since the sensor is very small in comparison.
Going back to the camera now. It is weather resistant to a degree (Truthfully, I never push weather resistance to hard.). Which for price is a huge plus for traveling and being an active outdoor photographer. The 12.1 Megapixel rating may turn people away from this when they hear other cameras having 18+ or now some being 24+. Though really, from experience, if you're going to post on Facebook, or any other social media or even print the 4x6/8x10 style prints. Then 12.1 Megapixels is more than enough. To be fair, those 4K TVs (this records in 4K too) are about 8 Megapixels, with 1080p being around 2 Megapixels. So after letting that sink in, don't let it worry you to much.
How does video stack up? Video works pretty well, I managed to get great quality video out of this camera. I bought a mic that is $36 from amazon and now its audio is even better. Plus this camera records in 4K, which is a big plus since my other cameras listed only record in 1080p max (K50 unsure, never use it to record). Now before I get ahead of myself, realistically it'd be nice to record at 4K 60FPS. Sadly this camera doesn't record at 60FPS, instead it records at 30fps and 24fps (4K that is). Like I said, I bought this for YouTube videos and thats perfect really.
I truly see this camera replacing my HX90v and RX100m3 on traveling. Though I don't know exactly how it performs at low light, I know it's going to be weaker performance than my other cameras minus the HX90v, which has the same sized sensor.
Now a quick summary
If you're looking for a fun camera that gives great photos, and great videos buy this. If you want a 4K camera, buy this. Weather Resistant camera needed for travel? You guessed it, buy this."

The camera does 30fps in 4k and 60fps in HD with reasonable recording time the ability to support an external mic and with a reversible display. It checks many of the boxes.

The camera has a metal body yet is not as heavy as you would think. Overall it's pretty decent.

The first time I used it however I was not happy with the photos as they all had to be severely corrected and still aren't the greatest. Somehow someone taking photos for us accidently pressed the white balance adjustment and took it out of the automatic mode making all of our photos have off colors and crazy exposure. We did not notice at the time due to the high energy nature of our event. The photos were salvageable but the video footage was not worth the effort to correct as it would have been a lot of effort with the changing lighting conditions. Having been burned by this once I'll keep an eye out in the future.

Photo quality is good but this is not a DSLR and the photos aren't of that quality. Very little depth of field and photos look like they are straight out of a point and shoot. The image stabilization for video is pretty good. I shot some B roll footage while driving hand held. I was ""iffy"" if the footage would be decent but it was pretty rock solid like the camera was on a mount.

Overall though this is a good ""all around"" camera. If you need to shoot video, take some decent photos and get things done it's awesome. It's never going to be a camera that you use for special projects but it's a lot friendlier and simpler to use than most DSLR's. I have several Canon DSLR's that also shoot video but this one seems to be better in a lot of ways because of it's simplicity and image stabilization. None of my Canons will shoot 4k either which is the primary motivator for buying this."

I wanted a camera with a bigger zoom and also like the feel of a bigger camera in my hands. I've owned a SLR camera in the past, back in the days before digital. With the SLR, the changing of different size lenses got old. So, the thought of having a camera with feel of a SLR and with just one lens to cover a wide range of focal lengths was a big appeal.

After going through many reviews of different cameras I decided on the Panasonic Lumix FZ300. This seems like a camera with many modern features yet at the same time budget friendly.

After having used the camera a few times over the past couple of years, I have mixed feelings. In a nutshell, there are things I really like and things I really dislike about the camera. As a point and shoot letting the camera do all the thinking, this camera is great. But to me, trying to go through the various menus and use the camera manually, I find cumbersome and frustrating. I'm not a fan of the touch screen and wish there is a disable setting as I find myself accidentally touching the screen which gets me a bit lost.

LIKES:
- fast auto focus
- 25 - 600 wide angle to zoom range
- ergonomics feels great (the best camera I've felt as far as grip and feel)
- weather protected
- budget priced compared to other bridge cameras
- viewfinder built-in
- articulating screen can be repositioned to various positions
- shoots in RAW

DISKLIKES
- menu and touch screen not intuitive, feels cluttered
- no manual focus ring but a tiny wheel for manual focusing

I give the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 three stars. Excellent as a point and shoot with a generous zoom but find the settings and manual focusing difficult to use."

Doesn't compare to the image quality of my SLRs but does a great job for a bridge camera with a small sensor. I purchased for general walk around photography when I don't want to carry my heavy DSLRs.

Good:
- 2.8 lens is wonderful
- Autofocus in movies works well. I was able to track a small sandpiper running around the beach without any out of focus issues.
- Button layout is very good with the dedicated af/mf button, function buttons, etc. Only improvement would be to have a dedicated exposure compensation button that works in concert with one of the dials. There may be a way to assign to one of the function buttons but I haven't had a chance to look.
- I really like the handheld night shot mode which worked great for some street shots at night in Quebec city
- Viewfinder is very bright and clear
Cons
- That tiny little sensor doesn't provide the same dynamic range as I'm accustomed to from SLRs
- HDR requires the image type to be changed to JPG first. This should be automatic when you select HDR. The option is greyed out when using RAW which is primarily what I use
- Bracketing doesn't have enough options. Can still do it the old fashioned way to get a larger range of stops but preferable to use the built in function.
- Chews through batteries really quickly
- I had an issue where the camera didn't shut down when the battery was low; it just went dead. I thought it had broken and just stopped working until I replaced the battery and turned the camera off and on a couple times to reset it. This happened a few times. Not accustomed to this as other P&S cameras I've had always shut down when the battery was low."

Not a massive zoom
So-so photo qualities in very low light conditions for indoors and outdoor photos, use a flash!

Overall photo qualities are pretty good outdoors during daylight, not so well in low light conditions.
Overall photo qualities for indoor photos with flash are pretty good, sometimes photos get washed out by the flash, so you can lower the flash intensity with this camera to fix that issue. Photo qualities indoors with no flash are not good unless it's extremely bright indoors. Use a flash for all indoor photos if possible with this camera.
Overall, 4K photos comes out rather good
Overall video qualities are quite good indoors and outdoors, especially during daylight hours, so-so in lower light conditions. 4K videos are fine, nothing really outstanding but pretty good still.

If you want a decent small-sensor larger digital bridge camera that takes overall pretty good photos & loaded with a lot of features & really don't need or want to spend hundreds of dollars more on the bigger sensored FZ-1000, FZ-2000 or FZ-2500, then this maybe the camera for you.
I gave this camera 5 star rating all because it fulfills most of my photo needs with no problems. It's a pretty good camera for being a smaller sensor camera.
Nearly a perfect digital camera, I would say."

What I wanted to do is pass along a technique for finding out how much your FZ300 camera has been used, especially if you purchased it used - as I did. The main thing I wanted to know is how many pictures the camera had taken before I bought it. What the camera will provide is (1) the number of times it has been powered on, (2) the number of times the shutter button has been pushed, and (3) the number of times the flash has been used.

Here's the process - I found it on the web: I used it on mine but you can check it for accuracy by searching for something like ""shutter actuation count on Panasonic fz300"". I found this to be a very useful tool when purchasing a used FZ300.
1. Insert a memory card into the card slot;
2. Turn the camera ON and take a picture (SD card must have some taken pictures);
3. Select P, A, S or M mode;
4. Turn the camera OFF;
5. Press and hold simultaneously the AF/AE LOCK, DISPLAY and RIGHT ARROW (WB) buttons, while turning the camera ON;
6. Now press and hold the AF/AE LOCK button, next press and hold MENU/SET and finally press LEFT ARROW buttons. You will show error table.
7. Repeat the last step with AF/AE LOCK, MENU/SET and LEFT ARROW buttons. You will show CAMERA INFO. screen with three counters:
8. First is PWRCNT. This is how many times the camera has been powered up;
9. Second is SHTCNT. This is the shutter activation count;
10. And last is STBCNT. This is the number of times the flash has fired;
11. Now you can press DISPLAY to toggle to the CAMERA INFO.2 screen. You can show date and time of first camera run.

This camera's images have a lot of funny looking visual artifacts in low light. The images are pretty blurry when you zoom in. Yes, every camera gets blurry if you zoom in too far but this one is worse than my phone. To make matters worse, even though the image is lower quality, the file size is much bigger from this camera.

My first time using this I was able to adjust the settings pretty quick without reading a tutorial. I took it to the beach with my dog and took some photos of him running around in the water on high shutter speed. The photos looked like trash, and they were smudgy and blurry. I almost returned it. I reset the camera to manufacture settings and lowered autofocus area, changed the format to RAW, put the noise reduction to -3. The second batch turned out much sharper. This camera does quite well in bright areas, it's not great for low light. It also has trouble focusing beyond 400mm. The 4K video is decent.
Overall I've only had it for a couple weeks so I haven't used it a lot. It's a nice beginner friendly camera, or if you are a photographer its a nice back up camera for jobs or lightweight hiking camera for scenery. It's not going to compare to a 5000$ camera but for the price I think it's reasonable. First photo is the blurry shot after opening the camera, second photo is after changing the settings."

But the model AMAZON sent does NOT have a warranty if you live in the U.S. like I do. It is only valid in Latin America. The model they sent is DMC-FZ300 PPK. (I believe the K = black, and PP= Latin America. It is still the same camera as the DMC-FZ300 K (which is what you want if you live in the U.S.). So I gave this camera 4 or 5 stars as a product, but no warranty drops it down to about 3 stars. Even though AMAZON posts a warranty page on the product site, the serial number on the camera would indicate the PPK model, so it wouldn't be covered. I will still keep it, but I will never buy electronics from AMAZON again.
The quality of the camera is very good, feels great in my hand (ergonomic hand and thumb holds), awesome zoom and image stabilization. Picture quality is 12mp (or less depending on format sizing), but for the cost vs. quality, it is good for wildlife, birds, etc. All of the controls and knobs have a very good quality feel to them…. tight but still easy to move quickly. The battery didn't last as long as I hoped for, before requiring a recharge. I would recommend purchasing a spare battery if you intend to shoot all day, or on a weekend hike, etc. Keep in mind that you have to charge the battery in the AC charger (AC outlet). It does not charge with a USB cable. This is about the only thing I would like changed on this camera.... the ability to recharge with a USB so I could recharge in the USB port in my vehicle.
If you do a lot of photography out in nature where there is a chance of getting rained on, or in snow conditions, this is a very good camera due to the weather-proofing and dust-proofing.
This is a very good ""bridge camera""... more functions then a ""point-and'shoot"", without having to expense up to DSLR with multiple lenses. The fixed zoom lens on this Lumix is perfect.... 25mm wide angle out to 600mm telephoto."

Cons:

Overall:
Even though it is an only 12M pixel camera, it can produce very nice photos and video, definitely good enough for social media and occasionally print-outs. Good for hobbyists."

The Leica lens... Magnifique!,2020-09-27,"I was a little scared when I bought this. I've been using Canon cameras for 30+ years, and own 2 other digital Canons. But I wanted to record video as well as take excellent pictures, so I took the dive. Thought, no biggie, it's an entry-level, not going too deep into my purse for it... Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise! Photo clarity is OUTSTANDING. So many features, it's hard to list them. But the VIDEO QUALITY!! So amazing! It sounds nuts, but I'd about swear that the playback of video shot with this incredible camera look better and crisper than REALITY. No matter what setting, it is glorious!

So, for me, this camera was an incredible, lovely purchase. There's really nothing about it I don't love. Easy to use, very intuitive (especially if you're familiar with digital photography and know how to frame a shot), crisp, clear, so many filters (should you want to use them), so many OPTIONS for CONTROL!! It's a delight to use. I've had it for over a month now, and it's rarely out of reach. LOVE it.

I can't imagine anyone finding much (if anything) to dislike about this Lumix camera. That Leica lens is OFF THE CHARTS great. Better than any lens I personally own (and I have a few!)."

Pros- Excellent ergonomics and stability for hand-held shots, aided by the large aperture and excellent optics
- I was first put off by the small 12M sensor, but after comparing the shots with a superzoom of 20M
sensor(same small size) and even higher optical zoom , I found the pics from FZ300 were generally sharper
and less noisy, showing more meaningful details on the distant objects
- 52mm threads on lens, I usually attach a polarizer. This makes a big difference on sunny days.

Cons- None

Next version wishlist: Better sensor, higher 4K movie frame rate, in-camera focus stacking, keep it weather-proof please.

This camera is highly recommeded for hikers, campers, and nature photographers who want to travel light. I do not know if Panasonic will launch a successor. So wait if you like, but at this price it is a no brainer to me."

They are listed, below. I travel a lot and and shoot a lot and though I have been happy with the portability/flexibility of small sensor cameras with large zoom ranges, every one of them eventually let dust onto the sensor. Bad! Yes, I have even taken these cameras apart to clean the sensor (2x!) That's a lot of time and a lot of very tiny screws! So, even though this camera is bigger and heavier than long zoom pocket cameras, the weather-proofing and dust-proofing was the most important feature, to me, combined with the zoom. A few weeks with it, now, and I couldn't be happier. Rain and dust have not hampered thousands of picture taking moments. Good! But the amazing zoom and speed of operation on this camera is simply astonishing! With plenty of light, this camera takes amazing pictures in manual or auto, from 25mm to 600mm.

I would recommend this piece to anyone at all!!,2018-06-12,"This camera is one nice tool! As with any camera of this type, one must read the manual and study the camera to learn its secrets.

There are a lot of things on this camera that may never get used in the normal scheme of things, but there is a lot to love about this piece. I have been playing around with it and found some very useful things. The fact that it has a 2.8 aperture across all areas of the spectrum is great for indoor shooting. People complain about the battery usage and drain with this camera. I say get extra batteries if one plans to use it for extended shooting.

I don't expect to use it for movies that much, but it is good to know it is there in case I need to learn it. I also feel that you can learn the ""point and shoot"" mode until one gets used to it.

I am not fond of changing lenses as I am not a professional photographer. I just want to pick up my camera and go do shooting. I love the ability to shoot long zoom pictures. I love the burst features, the picture clarity is amazing and has the same power as a DSLR.

It is a bit bulky, but that is good for me because I have large hands and need the extra heft for that.

DSLR ""purists"" will tell you that its not a match for a good DSLR lens image. That's technically accurate but the difference they speak of for most photographers is indistinguishable at best when your Lumix FZ300 is set up correctly (See Graham Houghton's Lumix videos on YouTube for help setting it up)

Feels GREAT in the hand... nice ergonomics, wonderful to hold and shoot with
VERY fast focusing and a wide selection of shooting modes iA iA+ P, A, S, Scenes, 4K, FHD video etc etc
24X optical zoom plus digital zoom for a 49X very long reach (read up on settings to maximize image quality)
5 Axis image stabilization is seamless and very effective
F2.8 throughout the full focal length of the zoom puts it in a class of its own and makes hard to get shots easier.
High resolution LCD touch screen that can be quickly articulated to different angles of view
4K video that is EASY TO USE and saved in different formats plus Full HD video fornats
Still shots can be saved in RAW and or JPG formats
Bright electronic viewfinder is a pleasure to work with.
Two ways to activate the zoom makes it easy to work with
'iM' macro mode that opens up a new dimension for many photographers.
The MENU system and Quick Menu is excellent and well laid out with a great many choices
Overall a 'bridge' camera package loaded with useful technology to assist in taking better quality images.

H O W E V E R ----- Many owners have had issues with the Zoom function button after the 12 month warranty. It cost me $246. CDN to have it repaired. I was NOT pleased and not a fan.

Quality IS an important and my camera was NOT manufactured in Japan but China.
I STRONGLY suggest a multi year extended warranty which unfortunately only raises the price...."

However, well lit ambient indoor/night photos have so much noise that it looks like they were shot on a flip phone that got sneezed on! I prefer shooting without a flash and have had many lesser cameras than this that did the job well over the past several years. I contacted Panasonic customer support and had the following chat:

Coleen M (2/16/2017, 3:21:07 PM): Welcome to the Panasonic Digital Still Camera Live Chat Support!
How may I assist you?

Me (2/16/2017, 3:21:45 PM): Hi. My camera is having an issue.

Me (2/16/2017, 3:23:21 PM): when I shoot a pic indoors at night with good general ambient light (no flash). The photos have an extraordinary amount of ""noise"" in them. More than my smartphone's camera.

Me (2/16/2017, 3:23:57 PM): Looks like it was shot on an old flip phone!

Me (2/16/2017, 3:24:27 PM): hello?

Coleen M (2/16/2017, 3:25:22 PM): I apologize for inconveniences and I will be happy to assist you with this today.

Me (2/16/2017, 3:27:14 PM): DMC-FZ300

Coleen M (2/16/2017, 3:29:40 PM): We would recommend that you take night pictures with the flash.

Me (2/16/2017, 3:30:13 PM): That's not an option
Coleen M (2/16/2017, 3:31:20 PM): We have no other recommendations.

Me (2/16/2017, 3:31:51 PM): I've had many cameras in the past and they've been doing great in semi-low light for years now. The issue I'm having is something I would expect from maybe right when they first introduced digital cameras.

Fieser,A good choice for people who want an all around camera,2016-01-05,"This is a very brief review. I had the FZ200 for more than 2.5 years. I liked it. I like sports photography, but can't afford DSLR's with top level lenses.
The FZ300 is faster than the FZ200. It has a better EVF (by far). It has 4K video, which may not equal the quality of 4K video from cameras with bigger sensors BUT you can extract single images from those videos, which comes in handy for people who want to catch the moment - the batter hitting the ball, the child blowing out candles on a birthday cake, the high jumper clearing the bar, the dancer making an unusual move. I had wanted to get the FZ1000, but got this instead when the price plummeted for about half a day in mid-November. I have had the FZ300 for about 5 weeks. Its image quality is a little better than that of the FZ200 - there are fewer ""blown highlights"", and a better dynamic
range. It has Wi-Fi and a touchscreen LCD, neither of which the FZ200 had. If you don't want to spend a bundle on a DSLR with various lenses, and you are not a pixel peeper, this is a great choice. Its main advantage over other longer zoomed cameras is its constant F/2.8 maximum aperture from 25mm all the way to 600mm. This means you can get roughly 4X faster shutter speeds at 600mm. You will be able to get sharp action shots when most other superzooms will give you blurry (because of slow shutter speeds) or noisy (due to high ISO settings) images."

No camera can be all things. Physical laws demand certain tradeoffs. However, this camera takes a strong position in the middle ground. It does everything well and does it with style. It fits the hand well, the controls are responsive, and the results are very satisfying. If you don't intend to print and enlarge your photos to great sizes to hang in a gallery, then consider this a worthy camera. The question is this, friends: ""Do you love photography or do you love cameras?"" If you love photography, you want a camera with you as much as possible. If you love cameras, you have several of them sitting around collecting dust. It may be the latest, greatest, most impressive, and most expensive but it is useless junk if it just sits around. There's an old saw about how the ""best"" camera in the world is useless if you don't have it with you. Well, if you want a long zoom camera that won't break your back or you wallet then here you are. The FZ300 lets beginners shoot in auto mode. For advanced type you can shoot in RAW mode or tweak dozens of settings and really get your geek on.

(On a side note, if you want a similarly capable long zoom camera that fits in your pocket, then get a Sony HX90V. I recommend it as an alternative.)"

I took a picture of the moon in the evening with the zoom all the way out out and hand held and you could see the craters! I can track moving animals by tapping the screen. If it is bright out, the little digital screen in the viewfinder works slick. I even figured out how to use the manual focus and it works lovely too. The flowers were taken with the zoom from the deck about a story high. Boston Terriers are just adorable... So I had to put a picture of my girl taken with my new camera on Amazon. Critics complain about the small sensor... But if you are looking to take photos that you do not plan to blow up into posters... This is a plenty big sensor. The lens is great. The camera is not heavy. I researched a lot of these ""in between SLR and point and shoot"" cameras and this was the best one I found for the features I wanted, and I was not disappointed. The first one I bought had a filament in the center of the viewfinder... I returned it to Amazon and got a new one the very next day. Love Amazon!"

For a superzoom it's constant aperture is a great feature. It has extensive manual controls and a menu system similar to the GH4/GH5. The image quality, when lighting is decent, is really quite good. The inbody stabilization does a great job, and the autofocus is much more accurate and much faster than I expected it would be. It's a great back up camera, at least for video, and it's about the price of a GoPro. I've used it on several paid projects that were smaller budget and it really added to the project. It's not as ergonomic as a pro camera and the battery and sd card both load from the bottom but as a pro videographer I highly recommend this all in one for anyone who just needs a camera for their family, travel, or begginer video enthusiasts. You'll be really happy with it. I would not recommend this to aspiring photographers however, or pros looking for a B cam on par with a Canon Rebel. The glass and sensor size just isn't there, but it's useful as a ""C"" Cam and when conditions, mainly lighting, are ideal the images are very useable."

The photos above show a tree in an animal sanctuary outside of Melbourne Australia, the 2nd photo is the koala that was lying on one that trees branches. I also like using an eyepiece to take pictures as sunlight makes it difficult to see the screen. Another benefit is the rotating screen which, when closed, protects it from scratches. The only negative is it takes a LONG time to switch to view your photo. This was not the case on the previous model FZ200. I would love it if they could make a camera, with all the features of this one, in a smaller unit. I usually carry my camera in a large pocketbook and this one takes up a LOT of space."

The pictures I have posted are as I unboxed it the second I received it to show all potential buyers just what to expect and to really see what is in the box. I try to do this with everything I purchase because there is such a lack of pictures of what is really in product boxing now a days. As you can see everything was perfect in the box and the camera fired right up with no issues at all. I will be doing a full review soon once I have used it long enough to put up a honest post. I also purchased extra batteries, sdxc cards, and other items to go along with this. They were all awesome and you can see them if you hit my name to look at my other reviews.

Carter,VERY Impressive New Panasonic SuperZoom,2015-09-17,"Just got it. The pre-release reviews sounded impressive. I bought it for traveling. And, after one day of sample shots, I am VERY impressed. The photos I've taken so far are incredibly impressive. Steady as a rock and excellent quality all the way out to 600mm. The highlights so far are: 1) 1/2.3"" 12MP BSI CMOS sensor; 2) 25-600mm equiv. F2.8 lens; 3) improved Venus Engine image processor; 4) very crisp Electronic View Finder image; 5) three 4K photo/video burst modes (haven't tried it yet); 6) in-camera processing for RAW photos; 7) really nice weight and feel. It sure looks like a big improvement over the prior generation Lumix FZ200. It's making me think about selling my big, heavy Canon 70D DSLR.

I also connected my iPhone to this camera via Wifi. It is easy to do and frankly using the remote control is an AMAZING experience. Not only did I connect using a QR code to establish a secure connection, but once connected, I had full remote control using Panasonic's ""Image App"" to zoom in/out, take shots, shoot videos, playback shots, send photos to the trash, etc. It's the same as looking at the LCD screen on the back of the camera! I could even upload photos from the camera to my iPhone -- I did it while out on a hike. I could also upload any photo to any of the social media sites like Facebook. The connection was solid with just an occasional short time lag when sending a command (like zoom in). Just amazing. It's a keeper!"

It has a few more bells and whistles than the prior model, but the important ones to me such as the zoom lens are still integrated into the camera. While I am still learning the tech, I would have to say it is a great camera for those who dont want to carry multiple lenses around. It is almost idiot proof and I am capturing some great images. The real selling point for me is the unibody dust proof camera body. I live in the desert and I don't think any other would do well in this climate. Highly recommended."

I know several of the reviews talk about ""too many features"". It's true ... this is not a ""pick up and go"" camera. You need to read the manual and practice. Find where the features are that you need and how to get there quick. Figure out what dial does what. Once you get past a bit of a learning curve, you will love this thing.

To get a 600 mm (equivalent)...nay, a 600 mm 2.8f...nay, a 600mm, 2.8f LEICA lens in a camera at this cost is phenomenal. Some of the bells and whistles are really cool features that make taking some artistic shots a bit easier. Of course, with the ability to shoot in RAW (or RAW+JPEG), you have lots of flexibility.

There's no time to go over every feature. The touch screen that rotates for convenience and the smartphone-enabled controls are some of my favorites thus far. If you're looking to not pay DSLR prices, but don't want the limitations of a smartphone/pocket camera lack-o'-zoom, then this is for you."

I didn't have to lug around my backpack and several lenses with my micro four-thirds camera. I put it through not all of its paces as I haven't finished with the user manual - there are so many settings, and that's a good thing for this geek/tech girl. I took only 77 photos and 1 video while on the hike. I tried out the sweeping panorama - love this feature. I tried out the iAuto for a while, then moved back to my favorite, Manual mode. I love that my 52mm filters work on this camera, the neutral density filter helped with the sky during the time of day we were hiking. While at home, I briefly tried out the remote app with my iPhone SE and it worked very good.
Pros:
The constant f/2.8 Leica lens
Comes with lens hood
Uses 52 mm filters
Remote shooting
Sweeping panorama mode
Manual focus
Shoots in RAW (my main requirement when looking for a bridge camera)
Focus peaking
Histogram and zebra pattern
I could go on, but these are the features that swayed my decision to purchase this camera.

Cons:
Haven't really found any yet

I would purchase this camera again (or if they come out with an FZ400)."

Anderson,"Decent until you want to crop a photo, not worth the price.",2015-09-30,"I returned this camera after 1 day of use. The sensor in this camera is only slightly larger than whats in an Iphone, so low light photos are terrible. For the price I expected much better image quality. The video quality is very good, and takes very smooth high quality movies, but that's not the main reason I made this purchase. The build quality is acceptable, kinda light and plastic feeling, and the smaller size felt awkward in my average size male hands.
Back to the image quality, the photos look pretty good until you want to crop an image, even in outdoor full light, even just a 50% crop shows noise, and digital noise around the edges of objects. Indoors with filtered sun light has even worse noise, the auto settings bump the iso way too high so the noise is terrible, but I believe you can set a max iso, but the average user isn't going to know this. My other cameras are a canon 5D2 and 70D that I use for studio work etc, and I understood that this could not hold a candle to that image quality, but I bought this for a walking around camera for family pictures etc, which for the most part it would have been OK, but for the price, I expected much better. You might as well stick with a phone camera or a much cheaper and smaller point and shoot thats fits in your pocket, the only thing this does better is optical zoom, and thats why I returned it. Maybe my expectations were too high for a point and shoot, but again, for the price, it just wasn't worth it to me since for another hundred bucks you can get a canon rebel which takes substantially better photos. I also didn't like the electronic view finder, felt like I was standing too close to a tv with my eye, a dslr view finder is much better/clearer, in my personal opinion.

I'm not sure who this camera is intended for, anyone that knows how to use cameras, and values image quality and does any post processing won't be happy. And point and shoot users should save some money and would do better with a smaller pocket size point and shoot like the canon sx710HS that you just turn to auto and shoot away."

This is a bargain, even with the usual accessories, compared to the real pro stuff, and I doubt most will notice the difference - this is at the level where it's the skill of the user that is the main limitation.

The price point for this 4k video camera is excellent. The quality it shoots is awesome.

I docked it 1 star because I can't get it to perform a steady zoom or focus because they aren't mechanical they're electrically controlled. I find myself over focusing then underfocusing on far away distant objects--to repeat what I'm saying, zoom all the way in on a tree about a mile away, focus on it as best you can with the manual focus and you'll see that the camera likes to jump over the spot you want it to be on. Hit record and then hold your finger on the zoom and it starts out slow and then speeds up at the last leg before becoming completely wide. --perhaps this is due to my settings, and if that's the case I'm still docking it 1 star because it isn't an easy setting to figure out--if it's even possible."

In the space of a week I have shot several hundred images with this camera. My primary focus is wildlife photography, particularly birds and butterflies. However, I also wanted a camera that is compact enough to carry around and to use for scenery and family occasions. Before purchasing this camera I researched a number of options. The combination of features in the Lumix FZ300 appeared to place it ahead of rivals. Experience with the camera has reinforced that conclusion. I am particularly pleased with the 24x zoom and the camera's ability to handle overcast skies and low light light situations really well.The camera focuses easily and, although the rich variety of features does require a certain learning curve, it is possible to acquire good images without a lot of experience. For my main purpose of getting good images of birds with a camera that is portable and comfortable to handle the Lumix FZ300 is remarkably good. With good image stabilization and the ability to shoot 4K video, for me, this is the go to camera for bird and wildlife photography short of getting a DSLR and telephoto lens. I also like the natural colors this camera is capable of capturing. I have included some images that I obtained using the Lumix FZ300 as examples."

Mine was a DMC-FZ300PPK, which is a Latin American model. The warranty is not valid in the US. I don't care, but Amazon should not advertise one model and ship you another.

As far as the camera, it is very capable. I used to have a few high end cameras and lenses, but sold them. I'm using this camera to bridge the gap until I'm ready to spend another $5-6k on gear. This camera is very lightweight and is packed with features. I am very impressed. Low light performance is not good (see the comparison shot between my phone and the camera). But I'm used to Sony's low-light cameras that produce no noise even at relatively high ISO."

As for the camera, it is fabulous quality, the pictures when you get it right, are clear and crisp. I love the touch screen and not having to use the view finder. It has a solid feel and I customized accessories like a wrist strap and stabilizer rack which fit it perfect. Effects and editing are the bomb if you can figure it all out and remember it a second time. I am still carrying a cheat sheet, after having it over a month.

I wanted something that I could have fun with, and take high quality photos with, without a huge learning curve. After hours (and hours and hours) of research, I finally settled on this. I figured it wasn't perfect... nothing is. So far I have been extremely happy with my choice.

This camera delivers great shots on the automatic function. I am going to include some photos I took in the first 24 hours I started using my camera, with no prior knowledge other than watching a couple youtube videos on the very basics of using the FZ300K.

I used the video to record music during a festival, and I was pleased with the quality. My hands weren't steady the whole time, but the video wasn't shaky. I could use some practice with my camera work...that's on me. I plan to use the video for some art projects and I definitely think it's a good quality video that will look professional once I become a better cameraman.

I am glad I made this choice. If you sound anything like me, and you're on the fence about purchasing this camera, go for it. Instead of spending hours reading camera reviews, spend those hours outside taking pictures!"

I really only bought it for the 4K video and to take pictures of family and friends, and for that it is perfect.

Intelligent photo assistant helps me take better photos right now while I go back and forth reading the manual and experimenting with settings.

I would give it five stars but I know photographers everywhere would probably have something to say about that.

Lens doesn’t come off. You have to have specific type of memory card to record long videos. You need to buy a string to keep the lens cap attached to the camera.

Hope this helps."

A great camera to carry for snapshot type pictures. Have been into photography for 35 years now and didn't want to carry all of my camera gear all of the time. I make a slide show of our trips and this camera fits the bill for that practice because of the zoom and video features. If I get a photo gig or want to blow up a photo for the wall I use my high end cannon camera and gear. Pictures are soft when zoomed all of the way out and this is not a great low light camera. Was not real happy with the built in flash so purchased an external TTL Bower flash. And as long as you do not blow up the zoomed pictures they are very acceptable. And unless you purchase a professional zoom lens for any camera your zoomed out pictures will be soft. The main reason I chose this camera over other large zoom types was the 2.8 aperture throughout the zoom. Overall this camera fits my needs and very happy with the purchase.

I was thinking about buying a longer lens for my Olympus when I saw the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 had a 600mm zoom lens and cost less than the single lens that I wanted to purchase. Also the lens is faster at F2.8 thru out the zoom range and it's a Leica lens. Even tough this is a small sensor camera, I found the photos very good. The camera has all the features for a more advanced photography and can also be used by beginners. I think it would be great for travel and nature photos. It has great features such as a splash and dust proof body, very nice placed control dials and very versatile touch screen that can be turned in different directions. The only negative that I've noticed is the battery life is not that great. I purchased an extra battery and would highly recommend that to anyone purchasing this camera."

A few days after I got it we went on vacation and I took some fantastic pictures. That was without knowing truly how to use the camera. Can't wait to see what happens when I actually learn how to use it! I've had more expensive cameras that don't take pictures that turned out this well. I was looking for a good camera, under $500.00 that didn't require me to change lenses. I always seemed to have the wrong lens on when I wanted to photograph something. After awhile it gets bulky and tiresome to lug around different size lenses. This camera has it all and I am very excited about learning more and taking even better pictures. I do have to say though that personally, without the Youtube videos, I would be completely lost in trying to figure this camera out. It is a bit tricky with all the different control functions."

It was somewhat difficult to get everything set up properly, even though I have used Canon DSLR's for years and am familiar with terminology and settings. If there is anything I dislike, it is the battery/memory card cover. It seems difficult to latch and open and I don't feel that the latch holds very well.

I love this little camera and I'm learning to coax great images out of it. Point-and-shoot people won't even notice the noise I suspect, especially when shooting in full auto. Final thoughts: it seems they went above and beyond to give the consumer the biggest bang for the buck. Most of the bang is in the software and features. They cheaped-out with the CMOS sensor and build materials, but it's tolerable and forgivable considering what you get =] It's an acceptable balance and I recommend the camera."

Pretty nice images once you get the settings tweaked. Bulkier than I thought, but not heavy.
Great for intermediate shutterbugs, or if you just dont want to lug all that SLR gear with you. Low light images only average due to small sensor. Over ISO 800 very noisy. In cam image stabilization is nice.
The bundled editing software is not much use.

It has an EXTREMELY fast auto focus, more zoom on it than I’ll likely ever need, and it’s very easy to use. I only paid $397 for it, but it feels like I should have paid around $600 for it.

Really solid for any beginner,2020-11-17,This particular Panasonic camera is really great for people who are starting off doing videos. I was slightly saddened by the fact that the camera can't change lens but the lens that it has is already really good. The picture quality is amazing but what is even better is the video quality in which the video has really high resolution. This is a really good beginners camera and can even compare with cameras that are a lot more expensive. I also really like the fact that the screen can rotate around so that I can see myself if I am blogging. Overall an amazing camera for a beginner like me!

This is not a large sensor camera but the zoom and ability to take great pictures none the less. Still a great camera with enough versatility to satisfy my want for manual control but with great automatic features. Menus can be a bit confusing, I struggle to remember what all of the preset function buttons do (there are 4 of them) and I also sometime forget how to get back to certain settings when rushing to take a photo (eg. using manual focus to take a macro photo of a moving insect). Love the fact that it is weather resistant allowing me to take some great pictures in the rain. All in all a great camera that I will have to spend some more time with and reading the manual for."

I know that. It's got a small sensor. I know that as well. Thus no surprises here. However, this camera takes much better photos than my old Canon Powershot SX230 despite having the same sensor. Just looking at the photos in factory settings I was close to returning it though as the photos looked worse than on my old, optimised Canon: very yellow, very grainy yet not sharp. After adjusting various settings for colour (bit more red and magenta), sharpness, noise and a few other things slightly (found a guide on DP Review) and shooting mostly -1/3 stops slower I have to say that I love it! The photos are so much better than on my old Canon. The detail in the photos is very good for such a small, old sensor, the colours are fine now, and the various shooting options that my lil'one doesn't have are fun and great to play with.

The only unfortunate thing is that I paid ...,2016-01-06,"UPDATE 12/20/17: I'm still using a FZ200 and gifted a relative this FZ300. Since my initial review, I've been able to get shots and video reasonably to my satisfaction although the lack of smooth zoom for video is a downer. The reason for my update and removing three stars from my initial 5-star review has to do my my recently learning of what appears to be some deceptive advertising of what this (and the FZ200) lenses are actually capable of achieving. When presented with the math, it actually turns out that while the advertised focal length is a 35mm equivalent of 25-600mm, the max. aperture is actually f16! So, be forewarned. Unfortunately Panasonic and a few other manufacturers are not advertising the complete 35mm conversion which leads less-informed folks (as I was) to believe that they are paying for specs. that the camera/lens is not physically capable of achieving.
-----------------------------
Original Review: So far, so good. The only unfortunate thing is that I paid full price--currently $50 cheaper. However, it was a time-sensitive gift order. I would not buy this if you already own the FZ200, but it is better than it in terms of build-quality and bells-and-whistles features. The lens and sensor are (would have loved a larger sensor) the same, but I could swear the firmware does a slightly better job with the JPEG compression algorithms. I likely won't with using the 4K features in the near future, but it's nice to know they are there when I am ready. While focused mostly on the FZ200, I highly recommending checking out Graham Houghton's YouTube instructional series--particularly for newbies. He has also started posting FZ300 videos as well.

Overall, the FZ300 is a point-and-shoot superzoom on steroids that I believe is money well spent as long as you know your needs and the FZ300's limitations going in."

They know it's not going to last too long. The menus are L-O-N-G many more options than you will EVER use or even read. It's almost as if they are trying to make for the plastic body by over doing the electronics.
BUT
The lense does wonderful work. This is an outdoor, hiking, wildlife, camera and takes beautiful pictures. Sharp, colors rich and true, spend some time learning how to use it and you'll get lots a frameable shots."

I like that I can take raw photos and macros both in auto and in different manual modes. Lots of features to learn and their manual helps. I also like the bigger lens which takes in more light. 28x zoom works great and the stabilization really helps when in auto and zooming all the way out. Also, works great with my iPhone 7 and the Panasonic wi-fi application. Having both a viewfinder and the LED screen gives you a lot of flexibility. A lot of times when outdoor shooting I don't have time for the LED screen and the viewfinder is a must. So you a aware this is bigger than a point & click and will not fit in your shirt pocket but a lot easier to carry than a DSLR camera and a bunch of big heavy lenses."

While I still use this camera for various types of shoots I find myself going back the the Canon due to it's better tracking when following a fast moving object. Sometimes the Lumix will lose focus and refocus which is a little annoying. I never noticed it with the Canon. Probably better mechanics inside the Canon. But overall a nice camera."

But I needed a new back-up, video-capable, camera so I gave this one a shot. I interviewed 50 exhibitors at a two-day makeup convention in LA. I had my Canon 6D rig - with a 24-105 lens, wireless UHF mic, and giant LED flood on top of a Manfrotto monopod. The Canon worked fabulously as always. The Lumix was a bit awkward to utilize..tiny buttons, on-screen commands, and a bit too many interesting functions. For instance - how many video formats do I need? (just one, 1920 x 1080). The autofocus spent a lot of time searching, which is a deal breaker for video interviews. The incredible zoom range of the built-in lens sounds fabulous if you're out on safari, but at an indoor event it's WIDE ANGLE you need, and this lens isn't wide enough. Ultimately the quality of the video, (the color balance, grain, and contrast) were not to my liking. I need people at a makeup show to have attractive looking, smooth, and richly-pigmented skin. The Canon sensor captures this. The Lumix did not."

I like the very fast (f/2.8) aperture setting available at the longest zoom--handy for acquiring images of faint celestial objects. Only drawback is the need to re-focus whenever the zoom is adjusted when in manual focus. Battery life is also a bit short (about 300 shots give or take) so have a couple of spares handy. When adjusted correctly it yields stunning images--my eclipse pics came out perfectly! Overall, next best thing to a full-frame camera and big bazooka lens costing thousands more...and a lot easier to carry into the wilderness."

I am more and more impressed with this camera as I continue to use it. It takes time to translate the menu system from Canon to Panasonic, but all the settings are there and MORE!

Of note: Keep your ISO under 800.. more like 400. I wish there was a way to increment the ISO limits to 1/3rd of a stop rather than full stops, but I wished that on the Canon system too.

Canon's have been my camera of choice for over 20 years so when my SX60 HS would no longer turn on after 3 years of hard use (carried on over a thousand miles of hiking in hot dusty Arizona conditions) I decided to look around a bit before buying another Canon as a replacement.
Frankly, I can't remember exactly why I didn't just stick with a Canon, but I liked the features of this camera, especially the Wi-Fi capability (rather than the slow Bluetooth) and an Android app which tracks my hike route then seamlessly write the geocode to the photos afterward.
The only thing I REALLY miss from the Canon was the 60x zoom... this camera limits me to 24x, which means I have to get closer to wildlife for the best videos. I just have to be more stealthy, I guess."

My issues with this camera could easily be attributed to me not knowing what the heck I'm doing. All that said, I was dissatisfied with the quality of the images I was able to capture, regardless of the amount of light present. I understand that this may be an issue related to the sensor size and/or my lack of skill re recording images, but I'd expect a long zoom/bridge camera at this level to be fairly intuitive in the point and shoot modes.

I ended up returning it and purchasing an FZ-1000 instead. My experiences with that camera have been much better. The FZ-300 has a few additional features that were cool (like 4K burst), but the FZ-1000 takes better pictures in regular and low light. The touch screen on the FZ-300 is a nice touch in theory, but in practice it was really unnecessary. I've had no problem getting accustomed to the FZ-1000's menu and making quick and easy adjustments using its d-pad. The only other feature that initially drew me to the FZ-300, dust and splash proofing, seems to be something that is truly only beneficial to more serious photographers or those who might find themselves in incredibly tough terrains for extended periods with little ability to protect the camera. I used the FZ-1000 on a two week safari in Tanzania and encountered rain, dust, etc with no effect on the operation of the camera or the quality of the pictures."

My previous Panasonic, which was a Lumix FZ200, unfortunately got flooded and stopped working. So I got this one and couldn't be happier. The image quality is the same high standard as in the older model, but there is a tonne of extra features, for example the wi-fi support. The only drawback is that the 300 is now a bit bulkier than the 200. I think this could be because of the additional gaskets, etc. needed for splash and dust resistance.

Favorite features:
- Touch screen
- viewfinder flips to see many angles
- super good zoom
- tons of programmable function buttons
- two zoom locations
- 1080p at 60fps
- Cheaper than the FZ1000 or FZ2500

Cons
- low light filming
- will only film for 30 min straight
- SD card is mounted with the battery so with a tripod the plate has to come off to change one or the other"

Got this for my kids sports. Zoom and lower light shots are great!

A little too complicated for me, since I don’t use a lot of the features. But I’ve taken decent videos using a shoulder mount ... looking forward to learning more.

Burst mode is also a plus when dealing with smirking teens and sports. Take 20 shots and get one that has everyone smiling more or less, catch just the right moment in the sports event. Delete the rest."

A fantastic camera that takes wonderful photos but is soooo heavy. Don’t take me wrong, I love that camera however the Panasonic FZ300 photos are as good if not better.

Taking it on a trip to Africa so I will post more reviews later.

After my safari: this camera was perfect for my trip! Great photos, excellent zoom and worked well in low light conditions. That's especially important on safari when you are often taking photos at dawn and dusk. Also didn't need to lug around different lenses. The action happens so fast there wouldn't be time to change them anyway. I mostly just used autofocus and snapped away. Exceedingly happy with this camera."

This is my second Lumix; even the old FZ35 took great photos. Decided to get rid of my DLSR and heavy zoom lens since it was not practical to carry around when traveling. I was going to purchase the FZ1000 but decided it was still a little too large so went with the 300 after reading lots of good reviews and looking at sample photos and videos on youtube.. Happy with my decision even though I passed up the larger sensor on the 1000. It's more than enough camera for this amateur photographer.

Camera worked great for about two months and then the telephoto completely stopped focusing. Sent back to LUMIX. After 3 weeks, they returned it saying it was fine. Camera will not focus when the telephoto lens is extended at all. A waste of a fair amount of money. This is my grab and go camera when I don’t feel like dragging the DSLR around. Now it is only good for objects close by.
Ordered this camera to use as a bridge camera during my travels. Worked great at first (although the telephoto is not as good as the CoolPix), liked the feel of it and the ability to shoot RAW as well as JPEG. However, after a little over four months, the telephoto refuses to focus, there is a blue glitter effect whenever you look through the lens (does not show up on photos but disconcerting when trying to set up photo), half shutter does not focus...I haven't even finished paying for this camera and it is not working.

Unfortunately there is one MASSIVE chink in this thing's armor, and that's the tiny little sensor they put in it. Because of that video and stills lack the ultra-fine details that should be present, especially when shooting in anything less than full daylight. Hated to return it, but if it either had a bigger sensor or was a little cheaper it'd be a no-brainer."

I upgraded to the FZ300 and the video and image quality are still very good. The quality of construction is poor. I never let it get splashed or any condition a normal camera would not be subjected too. I do exclusively use it outdoors and mainly for wildlife. After minimal usage the camera was making noises as it focused (on video in particular) and eventually stopped working. I sent it in for repair and actually did expect in this day and age that it would just be replaced. It was ""repaired"" and worked but still grinding while focusing. The on off switch broke off (its plastic) and I have given up. Again I can recommend it for video but very poor construction and poor repair after the fact."

I recorded a school play that was 2 hours. At best, I was able to conned the clips with Powerdirector 11 but not edit du to jitter. It took 18 hours to process. The resulting file was 80 gigabytes !!!!!

So you put up with a bulky camera, that still lost focus due to stage lights, for the 4k promise, only to realize the silliness of chasing megapixels and 4k resolution at the price of all this impracticality !!

So if you have nothing better to do, go for it. Your call !!!"

This may not be it.,2019-09-11,I was looking for really good vacation photos. This was not the camera for it. The picture quality was less than expected. We actually took backups with my Samsung cell phone. Zoom was great but iA+ and P were not much better than a cell phone. The pop out screen would go black at certain angles (defective) so most of the time the viewfinder worked best. Also there is a noticeable delay starting the camera to getting a photo. Several settings have very long delays between shots. This could be my inexperience with a camera like this.

I would suggest getting the extended warranty if you purchase this camera. You will be saving yourself a lot of money."

The FOCUS just doesn't work... and I've shared it with two Emmy winning videographers who both said the same thing. It struggles to focus, either in manual or automatic settings, unless one is zoomed way in. So, in other words, it's impossible to shoot wide shots. I really want to like this camera, but if it comes back from the repair center with the problem not fixed, I'm going on the warpath. This camera has already burned me on several important shoots for our Outdoor Idaho series this summer. Bruce Reichert"

We purchased the camera in November 2020 to give us enough time to learn how to use it properly. We thought the camera (and other purchases) would be coming from Australia as the purchase was made on the Australian website. We were so disappointed to find that the camera would be sent from the USA, even more disappointed that we didn't receive it until AFTER Christmas. Then to add to everything else, the battery charger was for a US power plus. We then had to purchase an adapter from USA to Australian and have only just received that. Now we will be able to charge the camera to learn how to use it. So much for being ale to take photos on Christmas day. Every other Amazon purchase has been promptly received so we thought this one would also. Unfortunately that was not the case."

BIGGEST problem: it overheats. i took it to Myanmar for a month, and yes, it's hot there--so the camera basically kept shutting off. this is NOT a Good Thing for a travel camera. too heavy, and too much electronics made it a lousy travel camera. my nikon p510 is MUCH lighter, ALWAYS works, long battery time, is a better travel camera. the reason i chose the Lumix was it was supposed to be better in darker situations. it is, as long as it hasn't overheated and turned itself off."

The 4k camera with interchangeable lenses, what else you can get?
It is overpriced in India, but there is no competition for it in India yet. 16 MP is low but if paired with some nice cheap lense, it does deliver cinematic pictures and videos.

I have 3 different lenses for it and it does the job for me.

I will update more as time permits"

I am loving this camera. I have no previous of DSLR experience or micro-third cameras, but I am learning it with this camera. The camera is excellent. The kit lens from Lumix is super, it a ""jack of all trade"" for beginners like me. The Panasonic bag provided with the G7 is of excellent quality. It can hold the camera and at least 3-4 lenses. The bag is very strong and looks to weather rough use. A 32 GB SD card also comes with the camera.

I have checked the 4K movie too, but I think I won't be able to use this feature much because of storage constraint. A 15 secs 4K video clips take 615MB of storage! So, making a 10 min video will eat up 60 GB storage at least. 1080p HD is very good & I am quite familar with the 1080p 60fps format from my previous Canon Vixia R50 camcoder experience. And at present I will stick to it.

The 16 MP in compare to other 24 MP cameras does not matter much to me, I am not into printing profession. The kit lens can capture more than enough details, which will work great for me. The auto-focus is quite good and the camera is very quick.

The only bad thing is the battery, the 1200mAh battery just do not have enough juice for video recording sessions. I will need at least 180 mins of recording time, but the battery will only last upto 50-60 mins. So, I will have to stock extra batteries. I am not very keen on these cheap Chinese AC adapter with DC coupler thing as any power surge can damage my beautiful equipment.

Nobody can beat this Panasonic micro-third G7 camera in combination to the cheap & high quality lenses. I already got the 25 mm prime lens and now I have ordered the super hit 45mm-150mm zoom lens on Amazon. My kit is complete with the 14mm-44mm kit lens, 25 mm prime & the 45mm-150mm zoom lens. Total cost of ownership is less than 60K, which is much less than body price of entry level Nikon/Canon/Fuji with 4K option. The beauty is when I upgrade to GH5, I have the minimum lens kit ready.

Pros:
- Best budget 4K camera money can buy
- Excellent for both video and photo shoot
- Sharp photos, true color
- Cheap but best quality lenses from Lumix
- Low cost of ownership
- Best kit lens (14-42mm) compare to any DSLR / micro-third cameras
- 4K video recording
- 1080p at 60 fps
- Photos at ISO 6400 is quite good
- High quality, weather resistant bag
- 32 GB SD card supplier
- Supports the 64 GB UHS v30 SD card from SanDisk
- Lumix lenses are the cheapest compare to any other brand lenses

Cons:
- Battery is only 1200 mAh, which may not be enough
- No in body stabilization
- Not weather & dust proof"

I recently received a Panasonic G7 from Amazon, and I have already shot over 20,000 frames with it during the seven weeks I've had it (with many different lenses, and with mostly using the electronic shutter), plus a few video tests. Since I already own the Panasonic G5, and GH4 (and I also had the G6), and have shot over 125,000(!) photos with these MFT cameras, I was familiar with Panasonic cameras, and also with the menu settings changes I generally make to get what I want in the images. The G7 fits “neatly” between the very small and light G5/6 bodies and the considerably larger and heavier GH4 (although that one is still relatively compact compared with most dSLRs, and its MFT lenses are also generally very compact and light – and this gear is FUN to carry and use!). I value the GH4 for its excellent EVF, great grip (it is easy and secure to use one-handed), its excellent set of useful external controls, its wide range of useful options in its easily-used menus, the excellence of its stills-quality (with selected type and sample of lenses, and with customized menu settings), and its great video capabilities. I value the G5 for its sharp EVF (the one on the G6 has better color and contrast, but it is not as sharp), its miniscule size and weight, its very good external controls and menus, and the excellence of its stills and video (although the G5, unlike the G6, has no external mic input, and it is without focus-peaking).

The G7 is a nice combination of the good qualities of both the G5/6 and the GH4, at a lower price in size, weight, and cost compared with the GH4 - although it is without weather-sealing and high data-rate and slow-motion 1080 video options (but it does have 100Mbps 4K-24/30P video plus “4K-Photo” options). The excellent EVF is similar to the one in the GH4, the grip is almost as good, the external controls (both buttons and knobs) are unusually numerous and useful, and the menus are similar to, and consistent with, those of the other models in the line. A few items have been added to what the G5 had: 4K-Photo/Video, the tone-curve adjustment shared with the GX7/8 and GH4 (I find this very useful!), “Diffraction Compensation” (I briefly tried this and decided to leave it “Off” – it progressively sharpens the image as the lens is stopped down to its smallest stops to offset the softening normally resulting from diffraction, but this can result in excessive noise even in good light - and this sharpening can be done better during editing), and an external mic input similar to the one on the G6 (but missing on the G5 and GX7). Using the G7's electronic shutter, leaving the EVF and camera always-on during shooting sessions, and using no flash, I get well over 600 JPG highest-quality frames per battery charge.

As for color and other photo characteristics, I appreciate having the ability to adjust EVERYTHING on these Panasonic MFT cameras (color balance and saturation, contrast, color-curves, sharpening and noise-reduction levels, etc.) - and I also appreciate being able to match surprisingly well the EVF's characteristics with those of my reference computer monitor so that I get very useful and accurate previewing while using the EVF (with a floppy wide-brimmed hat worn while outdoors to shade the EVF). These cameras are a ""tweaker's"" (read, ""perfectionist's""...;-) dream come true...!

Overall, I have no real complaints with the G7, although a few things bothered me very slightly at first. As with the GH4, the rear “dial” (which on the G7 is a circle of buttons as with the G5, rather than a wheel as with the GH4) gets somewhat “hidden” below the rear surface of the camera toward the “dial’s” upper right – but this is to keep it from being unintentionally pressed/moved by the right hand gripping the camera. It took me a bit of time to remember the new way to access exposure bias adjustment (I generally use A-Priority, setting the aperture for best lens performance with each lens and/or for best DOF for what I want in the image – and I often adjust exposure-bias as I shoot, using the excellent EVF as a guide), and it required a button-push to access this on the G7 (the G5/6 and GH4 can be left with the rear thumb-wheel needing only to be moved in order to adjust exposure bias). But, I discovered that with going into ""Dial Set"" in the menus, I was able to enable exposure biasing with a simple turn of the rear wheel (no button press required!;-). Also, the image resolution is very slightly smaller than that of the other Panasonic cameras I've used, but this is of little practical consequence. And, as others have noticed, the G7's (and also my GH4's) serial number tends to ""evaporate"" - and with my G7, there is now no trace remaining of that number. Panasonic has recognized this issue, and if both the box label with the serial number and the purchase invoice are retained, and if the camera is registered with Panasonic, the warranty will be honored.

Bottom line: this is one HECK of a nice camera, at a very decent price! Highly recommended! (A few photos taken with the G7 are attached...)

I don't like the neck strap that it came with; it burns the neck when walking around. I will be buying a better neck strap! It has a lot of features that I am still learning. All of the pictures I'm taking are basically me feeling out the camera and getting familiar with it. Soon I'll have watched enough instructional videos in oder to custom set the camera to my liking for whatever picture I want to take, and then I'm positive that those pictures will show me just how amatuer these initial pictures really are. All in all, I am having lots of fun with the camera and loving the results. I would recommend it to anyone."

Corona,Probablemente la mejor cámara por el precio. Lumix G7 vs Canon Rebel T5i.,2019-02-09,"Todos sabemos que las camaras de calidad tanto Reflex como Mirorless son caras. Yo uso la camara para trabajar, tenemos una agencia de marketing digital. Antes usaba la Canon Rebel T5i y ahora estamos usando esta Panasonic Lumix G7.

Principales diferencias entre la G7 y la Rebel T5i:

TAMAÑO Ganador: Lumix G7 - La G7 es mirrorless por lo que es mas chica de tamaño y mas ligera . Ademas usa sensor micro cuatro tercios por lo que los lentes son mas compactos comparados con los de la Canon.

CALIDAD EN FOTOGRAFIA Ganador: Lumix G7 - Usamos tanto la Canon T5i como la Lumix G7 para tomar fotografia de comida y creemos que la G7 es mejor que la T5i por la viveza de los colores. El unico punto negativo de la G7 es que las fotos son en tamaño 16MB y las de la Canon T5i es de 18MB.

CALIDAD EN VIDEO Ganador: Lumix G7 - La G7 graba en 4K por lo que no hay punto de comparación. En video la T5i no tiene nada que hacer contra la G7.

FUNCIONES EXTRAS: Ganador: Lumix G7 - Aun no termino de descubrir al 100% la camara, pero hasta ahora he visto dos funciones muy practicas que no tiene la T5i. La primera es foto en 4K; basicamente te permite grabar pequeños clips de video y de ahi sacar fotos 4K de excelente calidad de 8MB. Y la otra funcion es la de timelapse: se pueden crear los efectos de timelapse muy fácilmente.

FACILIDAD DEL SOFTWARE: Ganador: Canon T5i - Quiza es porque aun no me acostumbro al sistema de Panasonic, pero se me hacia mas facil el sistema Canon. Pero igual aquí es cuestión de acostumbrarse.

Creo que las camaras Reflex ya van de salida. Si vas a comprar una camara te recomiendo una mirrorless. Y si estas comparando entre la Canon T5i y la Lumix G7, te puedo decir con seguridad que la Lumix G7 es mucho mejor. Tiene mas funciones y podrás grabar video en 4K."

This fit what I was looking for and the price range I was in. My photos are decent, but can get better as I learn more about post processing and editing. But this camera has served me well for years and I've used it a lot while on trips with excellent results at least to me. I do wish it better stabilization. Some third party brand lenses that have stabilization in them won't work with this camera body. Only Panasonic branded lenses will work with the stabilization for this model. The newer cameras are more up-to-date with this stuff and interchangeable with the stabilization.
I may upgrade in the future but this camera is still great quality and I will continue to use until then."

I recommend that you get a dummy battery that can plug into an outlet so that you can have infinite battery life. I haven’t ran into any overheating issues at all which is something that apparently could happen.

One downside is that this camera is only able to record in 4GB chunks before splitting into a different file. This doesn’t effect the video in any way and it can still record for as long as your SD card can hold, but it does mean you have to put over 20 separate clips on a timeline in order when editing. This is really not a big deal, but just something to consider I suppose.

Overall, this camera rulez, and I would even go as far to compare its Quality to the LUMIX S5. The S5 is superior for multiple reasons, but the output quality for 4k video at 30fps is comparable.

If you’re looking for a budget camera to shoot high quality footage this is definitely your best bet."

There are many, many reviews and guides on Youtube on how great this camera is, and the fact that this is now considered a ""late"" model creates the opportunity for el-cheapos like me to enter the 4k world. I do not personally have a GH4 to compare this to, but from my understanding this camera provides comparable 4K footage with better low-light performance to the GH4. It definitely out-performs my Canon's in low-light situations.

I would not dare shoot over 800 ISO on my T3i or T6s due to serious grain. I shot a video at 1600 and the grain was near imperceptible to me.
The attached shots are not a perfect comparison, as the T3i is using a flat color profile, and I have not found the flat color profile on the G7 yet. The greatest difference is the amount of grain between the two. The t3i is at ISO 800, and the Panasonic is at ISO 1600. This is concerning given the T3i APS-C sensor is bigger than the Micro 4/3 sensor in the Panasonic.

The Panasonic has a ton of knobs and buttons that make switching exposure settings a breeze. The biggest ""feature"" is a hidden ""unlock"" that allows you to film without a limit in 4k (Check Youtube for tutorial on unlocking the G7 - this is not a hack, but a button sequence). I use Magic lantern on my T3i to get this, and this does not exist on the t6s (limited to 30 min video). The G7 can capture well over an hour of 4k footage on a battery charge without interruption, and seamless video between files. (the T3i hack skips a few frames to continue)

Other features: Mic Jack, Micro HDMI Jack, continuous autofocus, small footprint,

Biggest con: If you have invested in Canon glass, you will have to pay $$$ to get the right speed booster/adapter to connect to this camera. There are many inexpensive options out there, but with those you have to be willing to set focus manually, and I have no idea on how you would set aperture.

Message to CANON - Get the hint! your fans are being pulled away! Create an entry level 4k option that is not crippled! I am not sure why anyone would look at any of the entry level Rebel cameras with this camera on the market!"

After LOTS of research I decided on the Lumix G7.
PHENOMENAL camera, as far as this novice can tell. Mirrorless, so it's lightweight. The picture quality is superb, the autofocus is intuitive, the entire package is solid. And the 4k features available in such a cost-efficient bundle can't be beat (I'm seeing retailers offering it $100 less than what I paid for it a month ago now). If you're just starting out like me, you really can't go wrong with this one. I'm also a YouTube content creator (shameless plug: check out ""Chris and the XD in The C4 Movement"") so having this available to shoot up to 30 mins of 4k video is huge. I'm loving almost everything about this camera.

The ONLY thing that stops it from getting a full 5 stars from me: it has a mount for tripods, but the manual states anything over .22 inches is not recommended and may damage the camera. That rules out a LOT of the tripods I've been seeing. As a photography novice, to really learn the shots and get best possible images without camera shake, I really need a tripod. Perhaps options exist, I'll keep searching, but just keep that in mind as you consider options. If you're going to need to mount on a tripod this may not be the perfect choice. But if you're like me and just want to make some cool shots here and there, I heartily recommend giving this camera consideration."

En general tiene muy buena calidad y colores ricos.
FOTOGRAFIA: a pesar de tener sólo 16mp y ser micro 4/3, tiene una muy buena calidad y sin duda entrega resultados profesionales. Se defiende muy bien, aunque obvio no puedes exigirle lo mismo que a un equipo Full frame. Entrega archivos raw sin problema. Para poca luz si le cuesta trabajo, aún con lentes luminosos ya en iso alto si se nota el grano. Sin embargo, como backup es super útil y se ha vuelto mi cámara de viaje por excelencia.
VIDEO: impresionado!!! tanto en full hd como en 4k entrega archivos de altísima calidad y nitidez. para full hd tiene grabación en AVCHD (con un bitrate bastante alto) o en MP4, ambos hasta 60fps. y en 4k en mp4 hasta 30fps. Lo que más me gustó es que por default trae los perfiles de color cineD y cineV, que para quienes hacemos video es una chulada.

El equipo no pesa nada, es una delicia sobre todo cuando pasas horas en las grabaciones o en eventos. Tenía mis dudas de los sistemas mirrorless y esta cámara me ha abierto lo ojos."

Just know its limitations.,2019-11-12,"This is a hyper solid camera for the price. If you're looking to dip your toe into the Panasonic ecosystem this is a solid intro. I bought it to experiment with Micro4/3 and Panasonic lenses without dropping $2,000 on a GH5. It has some HARD limitations but you can account for a lot of them.

I have a couple uses:
1. In studio web shows.
2. Smallscale short film production.

---

In studio it's a beast. With good lighting and audio input this thing looks/sounds amazing. Even the kit lens. It's simple and straightforward, and the recording time/file sizes are super manageable. Additionally with an Elgato HD60s you can run the camera directly into a PC to use it for live streaming. I use it to record format shows/podcasts and run my audio directly into the camera. It's a super simple workflow made possible by how solid this camera is.

As a film production camera, this is where the limitations come into play. It doesn't handle low light too well. In my experience, the image was barely usable at 1600 ISO if you're trying to make a decent looking film. That was on my Rokinon 35mm T1.5. It just gets grain and distortion really easily.

Additionally the focus/autofocus isn't the most intuitive. The auto focus is practically nonexistent. I could never get a sharp image with it. On top of that, the focus peaking just didn't seem to do its job. With some practice you can get better at focusing this camera, but other cameras don't take the work. This issue was fairly consistent with different lenses and setups.

With all that said, depending on your use case you really can't beat it for the price. The 4K is solid and when you can get everything to come together you can make ridiculously good looking projects with this."

- Great Video Capabilities and great IQ in both 4K/100Mbps and 1080p/28Mbps (and don't let 28mpbs fool you!! Panasonic's 1080p is way better than the recent Sony's with a really soft 1080p)
- Battery life is actually impresive making it very reliable for any type of work. (It's always smart to have a spare)
- File size and MP4 codec is easy and so friendly to edit even in 4K on my PC.
- Super friendly UI it took me nothing to set up and understand most features of the camera.
- ISO noise is improved or better than the GH4.
- Nice ergonomic design overall.

IMPORTANT Coming from APC and FF world. M43 size sensors are nothing to complain about. You can even buy a focal reducer to ""fix it"" if you're not getting that 35mm equivalent or bokeh bothers you that much. For me the sensor size is another nice but overrated feature that other brands use to sell and justify their costs along with other lousy features but almost never a real IQ improvement but.. hey you get a real nice and expensive door stopper so don't let me stop you.

The only minimal cons I have are

- The kit 14-42 lens size and plastic feel. ( Yes, it looks and feels more like a little toy lens than a real lens yet it holds amazing quality for a kit lens)
- LCD color/temperature is inacurate but you can tweak it a bit on your settings.. still double checking the OLED LVF for colors/temp will help you alot.
- Saddly no HDMI out on this one while recording.. BUT you can use Panasonic's Image app via Wifi and use any smartphone or tablet as a monitor and camera controller.
- Very lightweight for handheld shoting (if you like that kind of work) attempting this you'll end up with a lot of beautiful shaky 4k footage even if you have good pulse but also this can be improved with a weighted handgrip or cage.
- SD card compartment at the bottom. (Not an Issue if you have a high capacity SD card but it is if you're constantly changing it)"

I got it for $500 on Black Friday. Considering the features and quality, it beats the pants off of just about every camera out there for that price. The picture and colors and stunning. Sharp, crisp and clear. The auto focus is plenty fast and accurate except in low light where it hunts and pecks a bit. The controls are intuitive and easy to get at. The record button is flush and hard to find at times but you get used to it and no worries about accidentally recording. Plenty of Fn buttons to program your favorite features and functions for quick access. The lens is a nice and compact, providing plenty of field of view. Battery life isn't bad. I can shoot for several hours on and off without changing batteries and leave the camera on during most of it. Aftermarket batteries are cheap and easy to carry. The built in mics aren't bad either if you can protect them from the wind. It's not much bigger than the various point and shoots (Canon G7X or Sony RX100) but this one has a mic input and a fully articulating screen. A big bonus up for vloggers.

There are a couple of cons, however. The image stabilization is a bit jerky compared to other cameras. It's not bad but it's not silky smooth either. The 14-42mm lens is great on the wide end but there's not much zoom. But it's cheaper than the 14-140 and smaller. A nice, compact lens that zoomed to 80 or 100mm would be just about right. The body isn't weather sealed like the new G85 but that's a minor complaint.

All in all, the few minor complaints don't outweigh all the positives. And for the price (it's a bit higher now), you can't beat it. The new G85 has a few upgrades but it twice as much!

Pros
-4k
-Takes amazing pictures
-Takes great looking video
-Flip screen is sick
-screen looks incredible
-Every option you can think of is packed into this thing
-Lightweight
-looks sick

Cons
-Neck strap sucks
-The viewfinder is digital and doesnt really look that great
-The viewfinder also has a sensor on it that detects if your ""face"" is near it to switch between screens, and sometimes, when operating the camera, your fingers will trigger this, causing your flip screen to go black, not a big deal, but annoying until you figure it out and be cautious of it.
-the autofocus, not to mention varying options involving the focus can be tricky and not always what you want.
-too many options, the camera can be too smart for its own good. There are alot of features, and alot of bells and whistles, which you can use to your advantage. However, it can all be overwhelming and tricky to use. However the hardware layout of all the buttons is nice.
-the mic isn't very great, but what do you expect? the sound is useable

Final opinion: Buy it
Great starter camera, spend the 600 bucks, get an extra battery and start shooting. All of the things I dont really like about the camera don't hinder its performance, with the occasion of the occasional autofocus mishap"

I originally bought the silver one because it looks sharp - very classy especially with the knurled metal knobs (they are NOT plastic as some have claimed). However, in many lighting situations, it's just about impossible to read the icons on the knobs because it's white-on-silver. See attached pics. Also, the silver finish of the camera body is smooth and feels like plastic; on the black version the finish has more of a metal flake texture and just makes the camera look and feel more ""pro."" And of course the knobs are MUCH more readable on the black version.

For the nitty gritty on the camera itself, do what I did - spend obscene amounts of time reading/watching reviews ;-) There really is no other camera like it at this price point right now. I almost sprung for the GH4 (4k video is really important to me), but as many reviews will tell you, the G7 actually does a tad better in low light - certainly with noise levels. For HALF the money! If you want a killer 4k video rig especially for low light work, the G7 is what you want. Yes, it's not a magnesium weather sealed body, but it actually is really well made (polycarbonate) and feels great. The light weight was off-putting at first after years of DSLRs, but I've gotten used to the G7 and wouldn't trade it for all that weight and bulk!

One other thing: I originally got the smaller kit lens version but returned it for the larger one (14-140). The zoom range on the smaller one just isn't much, and the larger lens will do just about anything all in one lens. Between that and Panasonic's excellent 45mm F1.7 ($350), I'm set for everything I need. So there you have it - amazing piece of gear!"

I'm pretty much a beginner and I can use it. You could set it on auto everything and it's a no brainer, just push the button. I use manual focus for videos because the auto focus will go in and out when you move, even the slightest bit, even while simply standing in front of the camera. It's 4K and I realized that my computer's flat screen monitor is not even 1080p, so I have no idea what it is capable of. It looks incredible on my 1080p flat screen TV! I bought it for video, but I think photography with it would be fun too. It takes pics with such fine detail I can see things I never noticed before in pics, like the tiny little chip between my front teeth. Don't let the auto focus issue stop you from buying it. I've researched and all cameras seem to have that problem. Maybe a 1,500 camera has ""better"" auto focus, but it will still not be perfect, like a movie you see on TV. The auto focus will still lag and stray some. Remember, it has manual focus too. It looks really hi-tech to me with a gazillion knobs, buttons and dials compared to my old 35mm. Very light weight too."

I wanted to shoot fun YouTube videos without spending tons and tons of money for a cool new camera and separate lens. This has everything you need for a relatively reasonable price. Pictures and video look clean and crisp, and you can watch a video tutorial or two to get familiar with all the buttons. Letting the camera just do its thing is fine too though unless you're a pro, and if you are you've probably moved on to something more expensive. Overall I'm really, really happy. A great investment for those of us that want something nice but don't have to go overboard.

ONE NOTE: When buying on Amazon it asks if you want to buy the ""Camera Only"" or ""w/ Batter Pack"". You WILL get a battery if you choose ""Camera Only"". I paid the extra $50 for the battery pack and received the camera with a battery and charger in the box. Then a few days later I got a second battery. It's certainly not the worst thing in the world to have a second battery for these things, but just know you WILL get a battery if you choose the cheaper option. The wording is deceptive."

I purchased this camera solely for its 4k video capabilities and it does not disappoint. The big surprise was the quality of the photos I was getting with this camera. In many cases, the photographs rival those taken with my Nikon. I am totally in love with this little camera and find myself reaching for it more and more.

I have used this camera to take every kind of image. Portraits, landscapes, astrophotography and wildlife. The Panasonic Lumix does not disappoint! I am still discovering great new features that make this camera even better.

Excellent in low light with minimal noise.
Creates outstanding timelapse videos in 4K and 1080P with just a few minor settings.
Shoot in RAW! Oh yeah!
The rear touch screen is a joy to use and the viewfinder shows you exactly what the image will look like before taking the picture. You can preview all of your image settings live as you make them.

The kit lens performs well and is sure to make anyone happy but this little camera really shines when you put some good glass in front of it. I wanted to use my Nikon glass with this camera and luckily there is an adapter that I seriously consider to be a secret weapon.

The Metabones adapter lets me use all of my Nikon glass with this camera! The image quality is simply outstanding! You do lose most of the auto functions like auto focus and auto aperture with the adapter but with the built in focus peaking system it is super easy to see exactly which parts of the image are in focus.

It’s okay, just not as good as Canon.

However if you don’t need perfect auto focus, like in a professional setting, this thing has a beautiful 4K image along with tons of great lenses. Remember, any lens from any camera system that has ever existed works with Micro Four Thirds (pretty much) if you have the proper adapter.

The HDMI feed will cut out when you’re in record, but that’s not a big deal for me. I have both an external monitor for pulling focus and an old iPhone attached to my SmallRig cage running an App called “FeildMonitor” to monitor my framing. That App runs so much better than the Panasonic one.

It is sort of a shame that this camera doesn’t have a headphone output. However for me personally that is okay because I use an external Audio Recorder that does. All is well there.

A lot of people claim that low light is poor on M43. That is only slightly true. You may need 10% more light than you otherwise would in my experience. Get a couple Aputure MCs and you can figure it out.

Now, Micro Four Thirds may be on it’s way out. But who really knows? If it becomes obsolete than maybe the old lenses will get even cheaper. It’ll still always shoot 4K. So there’s that."

La G7 es una impresionante cámara todo terreno, combina una calidad de imagen sólida, un impresionante rendimiento de enfoque automático y capacidad 4K (UHD) en un cuerpo compacto con controles externos que son fáciles de alcanzar sin ningún problema. La interfaz de usuario puede ser un poco difícil de manejar, pero nada como una cámara Sony, tiene la capacidad de usar la pantalla trasera como un panel táctil para establecer el punto AF.

=> Es Buena para: Principiantes que buscan una cámara para crecer o propietarios de cámaras DSLR que buscan una segunda cámara más pequeña y liviana: especialmente aquellos interesados para grabar videos.

=> No es tan buena para: Usuarios que desean simplicidad. Fotógrafos obsesionados con una calidad de imagen absoluta.

La verdad es que es la mejor cámara mirrorless por el precio, una de las compras más interesantes que hice para un proyecto de podcast con video en vivo, complementándola con una de esas baterías que pones en la cámara y puedes conectar directo a la luz, eliminando la necesidad de estar cambiando pilas en medio programa. También le puedes hacer un pequeño hack para quitar el tiempo máximo de 30 minutos para grabar en 4k, lo puedes encontrar fácil en youtube o en google."

First things: solid camera but not worth the current going price of nearly $800. Might be supply chain issues but whatever, I wouldn’t pay $800.

Camera performs very well with pics and video but you’ll need to tinker with settings to get rid of noise, especially with the kit lens. Once I got a different prime lens, the camera’s shot quality improved tenfold.

Special notes on video is anything handheld on a non-OIS lens produces a lot of shake. You’ll need to invest in some expensive lenses or a stedicam type setup.

Lots of options and settings that can get overwhelming, so read the manual. Definitely a step up from my previous DSLR but only if you get some good lenses to pair with the camera."

This is my first...But this camera is worthy of a review.

Pros of this camera- Amazing quality, even though it's 16 MP it has stellar 4k Video, Photos are great, but the video is this camera's strong point.
Pros- Lightweight. Compared to my DSLR, WOW! This is very easily carry-able.
Pros- Interchangeable lens's. I have both the telephoto lens and the lens that comes with the camera from Amazon. Amazing!
Pros- The cost. Totally worth it.

Cons- The stability seems to be a bit shaky, maybe it's just the way I hold it, but it would be nice to have some stronger VR.
Cons- As I said, the photos are great, but not the main reason for this camera. I got this for the best of both. In my opinion, if you want the best of both, this is a great camera, but I must say the video is better than the photo quality.
Cons- Lens cap is a bit of an annoyance, wish that it wouldn't collect dust so easily, but i'm just being picky here.

Overall- This camera is the dream camera for a Mid Level Photographer/Video Person. As i've said multiple times, better for Video than Photo. I am a Photography Major, and this camera works just dandy for photos, but the video is the highlight. I would say if you're thinking about this camera, or a DLSR, go for this. Honestly, at the price this is, you can't beat it!"

I use the 4k Photo mode a ton to get that ""perfect"" shot on my daughter all the time. Been slowly getting into 4k Video, so this camera is great at that. I do wish they would just come out with a firmware update that doesn't hinder people from doing movies longer than 30 minutes at a time. But for now I don't mind doing a bunch of shorter takes and slice them all together in iMovie (eventually I'll upgrade to Adobe Premier).

At first I tried doing a time lapse of a 3D Print with just a normal battery and it died about 5-6hrs into the print, which isn't very useful when I like to do 12hr+ prints. So after doing a ton of searching around, I found the Power Adapter that worked for the G7 (since the G6 version didn't work for people), and I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to do long time lapses:
http://amzn.to/24CTdzX

Right now I'm still using the 14-42mm Kit Lens, and it's been great, but there are times I wish I would have just gotten the more expensive 14-140mm kit lens instead. So if you are like me and like having a more general purpose lens, I'd suggest just saving up a little more and getting the other kit lens instead."

I did hours and hours of research before spending this much money on a SLR/DSLR camera, and hands down this camera came up as the best choice. It has all the features and quality of cameras that cost twice as much. It's also a perfect starter camera for someone looking to get into more serious photography. I would reccomend looking up some Youtube videos and reviews on this camera to see all the features and quality before purchasing this one, or any higher end camera for that matter. HOWEVER, keep in mind, that many reviews are done by camera critics who rate this camera and others by extremely high standards, so they are going to knock this camera for having ""problems"" that the average person will never notice. The ONLY thing I agree with them that I could even notice as being an issue with this camera is that the auto focus is a little sluggish.. but if you are wanting to get into professional photography, you are going to have to learn how to focus your shots by yourself. Well there are two things, the second thing is that I had some difficulty setting up the wifi connection to my PC, but the connection to my phone through the app was super simple and quick. Besides that.. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!"

I almost thought something was wrong with the camera and I had even noticed a professional reviewer notice this same issue. Well, I solved the mystery. When the camera's functions are reset, the LCD screen is put into touch sensitive mode as a default since most people wish to do touch focus photos, functions and touch to snap. But if that's left on, then when you use the ""1-Area"" focusing mode, your nose is very likely going to touch the LCD screen just before your eye uses the electronic viewfinder, thus moving that focusing box to that new odd, off center, location. To be honest, I was about to return the camera over this one issue until after ten days it finally occurred to me what was causing it, my nose! LOL
In summary, the solution was to turn off ""Touch Pad AF"" in the Wrench Custom menu. The 4K photo mode was the right tool to capture the exact moment for hurdlers. see photo. Be sure to download the free Lumix Image App."

Se siente bien en las manos, la empuñadura es grande y en general es intuitiva.
El menú es sencillo de usar comparado con el de la Sony que es una pesadilla.
A favor de la Lumix pantalla, menú, posibilidad de usar micrófono externo y también el visor me ha parecido mejor.
A favor de la Sony la calidad de foto y el autoenfoque que sigue siendo u a referencia.

It's essentially a GH4 except with better lowlight. I have to admit that the best deal is (don't know if it's still going on) found at Adorama since it includes an Audio Technica Microphone.

I'd recommend this camera for a beginner since it includes the ability to shoot 4K video in decent quality. I'm approaching this camera from a video production position and while it's not up to par with say an Arri Alex, the value that can be found here is enormous. More so if V-Log comes out for this as well as the GH4.

I'm not much of a photographer but have had to use this during a shoot recently in addition to a Canon 70d. All I can say is that this was the better camera. The main reason is because of focus peaking. The majority of my lenses are nikons therefore when I pair them with this body, they're manual. That's not a problem for me at all but having focus peaking is a considerable help.

The image quality is outstanding, definitely on par with the top canon bodies (though without their features). Moving up beyond the 1K bracket I'd get the new Sony A7rII and while I don't think this matches that body, the difference for a beginner/intermediate or someone looking to shoot some video is immense."

I have no complaints about this camera. I am not a professional. I am learning to use a camera since this is my first ever! I have plans to purchase a telephoto lens to aid in my photography. I love landscape photography and the kit lens doesn't capture the landscape of my desert the way I'd like. The pictures are clear and the built in settings for picture filters are nice. Every setting is at your fingertips. I can upload the photos or video I capture to my phone for upload onto the internet via WiFi that is built into the camera. All in all a great camera for a beginner.

Went with this.
Peak Focus, means quick manual focus to ensure perfect focus every time by showing a small band of color on the exact points the camera has in focus (very fast to use).

Super high-speed shooting in 4k mode, is surprisingly good, even in lower light.
Video quality is hands down amazing.

Kit lens is super sharp, for a kit lens.
Easy to hold if you have big hands like me.
DSLR feel, but extremely light.
Easy as a point and shoot, but enough dials, function buttons, and quick menu to give you all manual access quick and easily.
Best placement I have seen, for focus switch.

One day testing at the local zoo, and I was pleasantly surprised.
You just can't go wrong with this camera.

Other reviews say quality feels cheep. It is a little plastic y..but that makes it unbelievably light, and in no way reduces image quality.
Amazon, reduces quality of images uploaded so its hard to see the real images these cameras create on this site. Check out flickr, and just do a camera search for lumix G7... you'll see tons of high res images.

Best budget camera for YouTube.,2016-12-20,"I love this camera. This is my first midrange mirrorless camera. I upgraded from a Canon Vixia HF R600 and I could not have made a better decision. The depth of field on this is awesome. The background gets blurred and the object I focus on is clear and it just looks great. I do want to mention that I am not an expert on cameras, but I am learning with this. The camera has many features that are easy to use. The timelapse is great and the 4k picture mode is great for capturing fast moving things like if you're doing a backflip, front flip or something like that. It does reduce the picture to 8mp but it still looks good.

So I been using this for my youtube videos now and I been very satisfied with it. I am not using the 4k recording on this yet because I need a computer that won't struggle with it. I will be set whenever I am ready to start recording and editing in 4k so the camera is future proof.

This is the best deal I was able to find and would recommend you try it out."

It's mediocre. The picture quality is comparable to an iPhone's picture quality or worse, at least in my brief testing. I do real estate and portrait photography for a living and I have used a variety of DSLRs.

Video quality:
This is very great for the price! The video is extremely sharp and it exceeded my expectations!
The ISO in video mode is quite impressive, going all the way up to 6400; the footage is still usable at this range with only a moderate amount of grain. The reprogrammable buttons are actually way more useful than I initially thought they would be and the two turn wheels allows you to make adjustments easier and faster. Having zebras, focus peaking, histogram & audio level monitoring is also a huge bonus.
The kit lens is okay overall. It's sharp, but it has poor bokeh with chromatic aberrations and fringing.

Timelapse:
This is actually implemented very well. You have a considerable amount of control over your settings and you can export the photos into a 4k timelapse video from the camera."

The body feels better in your hands, the buttons and wheels give better feedback, and the layout is far more natural. It is a little bigger and a little heavier than the G6, but you only notice it during a direct comparison. I also was surprised at how much I favor the new angular design, which I feel aids in a more professional look.

The pictures are about the same quality as the G6 but the video is an immense improvement. Even using the kit lens, the 4K video is mesmerizing. The 4K burst photo mode works well but seems more like a gimmick than something I would use every day. *The screenshots I have included were all captured from 4K video.

The battery/SD card flap doesn't open up as easy, lacking the quick spring of the G6. Also, the strap holders are no longer imbedded in the sides of the camera, but rather hang off the sides like earrings (and since I never use a strap, this just gets in my way). Beyond these little complaints, however, there is nothing I dislike about the G7. I have undeniably found my new favorite camera and I am holding onto it for a long time."

The image quality is professional, especially while recording 4k (30 or 24 fps)- if you're a beginner filmmaker this is one of, if not the best option for you. Especially being able to record 1080p 60fps really brings out more creativity for slow motion shots. The kit lens is very impressive and produces an extremely sharp image. The only thing this camera lacks on is superb low light compatibility with photos, considering the shots can be grainy in low light with the iso bumped up to get a bright enough image - and a fast AF (auto focus), which can fade in and out while recording, even on still images which can be frustrating, but this issues are minor most of the time and don't get in the way. Overall, I'd suggest this camera to anyone, professional, mediocre, and beginner. It is truly an amazing camera."

The 4K video is excellent! The controls are well laid-out and accessible, and it feels really nice and well-balanced in the hand. It's almost the perfect fit for my hands and preferences. If this had APS-C stills quality, it would be nearly-perfect. If you're already familiar with, and pleased-with, 16MP, M43 stills, then the G7 is an excellent way to add 4K to your lifestyle."

Image quality is insanely good and sharp. Even the high ISO has a natural looking grain pattern. Shooting in RAW and adding some noise reduction and post-grain makes super clean and pleasing grain pattern in higher-than-ISO 3200.
Kit lens is super sharp. This is an impressive kit lens. Just wish it were a f/2.8. Stabilization is amazing in video and stills.

Some things I can get over but nag me:
Green status LED at top of camera stays on at all times. Not very stealthy.
I come from Canon-land and getting use to the new menus was a bit of a learning curve.
Panasonic's website and support is not user friendly. Manuals are interesting English translations, not super intuitive.

Neutral/Pros:
Camera is very advanced with next-gen technology. You will need a day or two to get the advanced features figured out.
Has a touch screen focus and exposure sort of like the iPhone.
Feel is ""light and plasticy"". But after 2 days, and handling my Canon, I don't like the heaviness of the Canon.

Lightweight is now my goal. This does it, don't let it fool you, the images are outstanding."

The G7 is a beast in low light and even though it has a external Mic plug the built in mic is one of the best I have ever encountered on a camera.

The G7 have a lot of settings to get familiar with but thankfully there are a lot of YouTube tutorials on these settings, I also have to point out that many photography Youtube channels recommend this camera as a beginners camera but seriously it is so much more than that.

Try this before you spend a fortune on one of the hyped up cams."

One thing i like this over the other 2 is it gives you the feeling like you are holding a dslr. I didnt pick the sony cause of its overheating when recording 4k and the position of its evf. I prefer it to be in the center. You may not need 4k but you are taking pictures or videos for the future, and 4k tvs will become cheaper. This one has the 4k photo burst which is fantastic to be used to capture precious moments that only happen once. Om10 doesnt have that. For the value, i think its better than the other 2 given that it has cheaper lens, good 4k quality, dslr build and a mic port if you ever find youself in a situation that you want to record urself at your convenience."

For the price of a full sensor camera, we can run and gun with 3 of these setups. couple with some quality glass and a rode mic you can not tell the difference in a 4k dollar rig and this. The autofocus features are huge for the rookie shooter but can still pull focus like a champ for the pros. It weighs nearly nothing and several of the cameras take the footprint of one full frame camera. Battery life is astonishing and is very light on any gimbal or stabilizer even with a telephoto zoom lens.

Update, couple months later and I bought 2 more I liked it so much. now my multicams are all the same quality and color and I am never running out of glass or batteries. My bag has 3 of these bodies and they just keep taking the hits. Very impressed."

I'm mainly going to focus on filmography with this camera and so far, it's been fantastic! The audio isn't all that bad, either! It picks up on sounds pretty well, near or far (wherever you are). For even better sound quality, i recommend just buying an external mic, which btw, the camera also comes with an external mic input!

If you're wanting to film for a while, be sure to get yourself extra batteries! The one it comes with isn't bad, but it won't last you hours of constant filming or just even switching it on/off multiple times and then using it.

Changing the settings helps, too. There were 1 or 2 things that bothered me before I changed the settings - like when I tried to focus on anything, it would show this box all zoomed in, and it would sometimes make the camera lag (only if the ISO was high or if anything was overexposed to light).

Overall, this camera is great! :)"

The price tag is beyond fair and honestly beats and nikon or canon DSLR i've ever used. The fact that this $500 piece of hardware is packed with so many features such as focus peaking, zebra and 4k capabilities makes it a very good, if not the best, budget camera out there. It also allows for the white balance values to be individually changed along with presets. The flip out screen is a nice touch and the picture quality is outstanding based on the size on the sensor. The camera is also very lightweight making it easy to transport everywhere you go. The only thing I dislike about this camera is the battery life which is, compared to my old nikon, a little bit worse, so make sure you have extra batteries if you plan to shoot all day."

Mine arrived on 4/5/2019 and the firmware has already been updated for you. The update fixed a lot of the slow focus on the previous version, which was one of the gripes about this camera. The auto focus is still a bit on the slow side, but it is MUCH faster than the previous version. I am overall super happy with this camera. I bought it for its 4k video ability, and the video that you get from this camera is amazing. It also takes REALLY good still photos as well. Plenty of options in manual mode and a ton of features you won't find on other ""budget"" or non professional cameras. If you are even thinking of considering this camera, don't hesitate. best bang for your buck"

It is greatly inferior to my iPhone 7 Plus. Slow pans that are beautiful with the iPhone are blurry and difficult to watch with the G7. Footsteps that are smoothed out on the iPhone are bumpy with the G7. And, unfortunately, they are not fixable using Final Cut Pro's stabilization engine. The only use for video is on a tripod or with no movement of the camera. That said, it's panoramas are stunning and better than the iPhone. There are no ""breaks"" in fluidity. And shooting in B&W is really nice. As I said, it's a great photography camera but you will need to go elsewhere for quality video."

I think they are amazing, bulletproof cameras. Once, my dad went snorkeling with one in his pocket. In seawater. It even worked (for a few hours) after he came back in. I disassembled it, and it was a incredible inside--layers of jewel-like Japanese circuitry encased in a thin metal skin. I did have one, recently, that stopped working after a few weeks, and Panasonic would not honor the stated warranty. It was made in China. I mention because, as soon as I unboxed this thing, it reminded me of a Chinese SUV. There are sharp angles everywhere. It is chunky and unnecessarily large. It is unwieldy. it is inelegant. It is squarish. It is boxy. The fit is not quite right. You want it to fit in your hand, but simply won't. The flash sticks way out over the body with shiny, sharp corners. The viewfinder juts out the back about 3/4 of an inch. Honestly (and I'm not one to care about such things) this thing looks hideous. The online pictures of it are misleading. Every angle of it looks like it's about to tear a hole in your clothes. I hate to say it, but after two decades of loyalty, many thousands of dollars in Panasonic products, an unhonored warranty, and then this monstrosity, I think I'm done with Lumix. Panasonic are a fantastic Japanese company. I'm okay with a Japanese design made in China. I'm not okay with a product that appears to have been designed by hacks from a child's drawing of a complicated camera. It looks like Frakenstein, fused together from 1980's camera parts and an engine block. I unboxed it, and then put it back in. I imagine it takes photos, perhaps fantastic ones. I don't know, because I'll never use it. I'm returning it, and I hope the nice, sharp baseplate doesn't shear a hole in the box on its return trip to Amazon.
I will have a Nikon digital SLR for as long as I live.
Glad I will be able to use all those 4/3 lenses...
on my new Olympus."

I defaulted Auto Focus and image stabilization to 3 stars, as I shoot from fixed locations, either a tripod or a top-down rig I don't really get to test the OIS. I also shoot strictly in manual mode, so I don't use AF, but from what I've played with it seems sufficient enough.

I'm a professional photographer and have both full-frame Nikons, aps-c sensor Canon and Micro 4/3 Panasonic GH4, GX8 and FZ1000.

The G7 is am amazing little camera. Even the small lens is surprisingly good. It came with a 12-42mm zoom (24-84mm full-frame equivalent). My son-in-law took over 1,000 photos on a trip to Oregon recently and they looked fabulous. He was shooting mostly in Manual mode and the controls for changing shutter, aperture and ISO are extremely easy to use (like the GX8, GH4 and FZ1000). The Panasonic line is pretty amazing.

If you want to move up to a more professional lens, I tried my 42.5mm F/1.2 Nocticron on the G7 and... WOW! The shots looked great! The G7 has the same sensor as the GH4. For the money, this is a very hard camera to pass up on... It also shoots crisp, clean 4k UHD video..."

I think I’ll be much happier with that."

Both picture and video look amazing and depending on the profile you can get great colors straight from the camera without having to do any color correction or grading. The ONLY drawback is the auto focus(AFC) for video. If you are shooting in 4k, the auto focus is slow and tends to hunt quite a bit depending on what you are filming. However, I found that if you shoot in 1080p FHD, the auto focus works fine."

But what is all this recent chatter about the missing serial
number on the camera? Mine wore off and is just about gone. I was so impressed with this camera, I bought another as a pre-xmas gift for
my son and he loves his camera but his cameras' serial # is missing also. What's going on? Has Amazon addressed this issue with Panasonic?
Two month's after I bought this new product line in late May and had to wait one month after ordering to get it, Panasonic extended their 1 year warranty to 3 years on cameras bought after August. Is that fair Panasonic, 2 months after introducing the product?
Missing serial # better not cause a problem."

It has a lot of wonderful features and it has awesome video quality. However it does have some glitches in it’s not very beginner user-friendly especially if you don’t know much about photography. I’m still trying to figure out all of the features and how to use it that’s why gave it four stars. Overall it’s a beautiful camera and It has a lot of features so I’m going to make some awesome first time YouTube videos and when I am more experienced and ready I will invest in a upgrade.

It shoots 4K and at the time of buying, cost $600 with a kit lens. Let's be honest here, those points alone make this an almost unbeatable deal. This camera also uses Micro Forth Thirds mount and has a wide selection of lenses available from both Panasonic and Olympus as well as 3rd party's. Want to use a canon EF lens? Easy get a metabones adapter and boom Canon EF lenses WITH autofocus still working. This camera is a polymer bodied camera without weather sealing, if you want those, look at the big brother GH4. But this costs half that.

I actually sold my Sony A6000 for this for a couple of reasons, first, the Sony lenses are just too expensive. A6000 has no microphone in for audio. Lastly, the Sony overheated after shooting 20min of 1080p footage."

I think they are great.

The issue is on read speed of UHS-II. When using UHS-II Class 10 1000x 150MB/s, it takes at least 3 seconds before the preview photo appears after turning on the camera. Once the preview is loaded, you can scroll through photos quickly. It is annoying to wait for preview to appear.

I tried it on 2 different UHS-II card and same result. I tested the UHS-II cards on PC and they are able to reach the 150MB/s speed read.

Then I tried using a regular SDXC UHS-I Class 10 95MB/s. The preview appears immediately regardless it was just turned on time or not. Note that UHS-I is using the regular set of pins on standard SD cards. The UHS-II is using a new set of pins. See the description on this link.

[...]

Panasonic's customer support responded to me that ""While the UHS-II cards (those with the extra pins) will work, currently none of our cameras were designed to utilize their higher speed capability."" - WELL, DONT ADVERTISE THE FEATURE THEN. This is one of my consideration in buying this camera."

I thought it was time for me to bump up to a more full size camera from point and shoots. I had a Canon G7 point and shoot and loved it but wanted to make higher quality videos for youtube and streaming and also do family photos. I loved the idea of the 4k capture and plucking the perfect moments out because I have 8 kids and getting the perfect moment is tough. That feature was not as good and not as high quality as the demo made it appear. The pictures were often not crisp so no usable moments were captured. Maybe someone who understood more of the professional settings would like this camera. Out of the box it was not user friendly at all or intuitive. I also didn't like the presets and filters compared to the Canon G7. At one point I couldn't even take a decent photo even with the Ai auto setting. After resetting the camera thinking that the setting got messed up I never really got a great shot on any settings. I Ended up buying a Canon m50 which I love so far and even without knowing all the settings I am able to take amazing photos. The quality of the canon just feels better and there is about half as many dials making tuning in to what you want more user friendly. Was a fan of the Lumix Point and shoots, but not this mirrorless."

Like many manufacturers of video cameras they go to the trouble of giving an HDMI out but it is for playback only. So, if you want to hook it up to a monitor to view while recording it goes black. I imagine this is not that imprtant to most but I do aerial video from a multirotor and this is essential. I am sticking with my Sony Nex7 ( Sony had no problem doing this ) and the G7 is being returned.

A few comments on Panasonic and their customer service and technical support. I pre- ordered this camera on Amazon and also contacted Panasonic to clarify whether it would output live video. No one at Panasonic had any idea, they said it was too new to know this. I then received the camera and again called them and still they had no idea if it could do this task. after having the camera for 2 weeks and trying every conceivable setting and not being able to get video out while shooting I called once again and now they are able to confirm that it cannot do this task."

G.,Love the compact size & weight of micro 4/3's cameras and the G7 delivers for me!,2017-12-09,"Excellent camera for the price. After using 35mm for years, I like the smaller size, lighter weight of the mirrorless micro-four thirds cameras and lenses. Though, I don't use its included lens, but instead, the Panasonic 14-140 f4-5.8 zoom (28-280mm equiv.). I also picked up a couple used Canon EF lens (such as 75-300 f5.6 zoom which is 150-600mm equiv.) and micro 4/3rds adapters. Have to use manual focus on those, just like olden days. But inexpensive and good quality glass.

The 4K video quality is beyond any of my existing home equipment, so looks just fine to me.

Also, resell value seems to hold good, as I have been able to upgrade every few years from G5, G6, G7 at about half price with Amazon's buy back."

I Would have loved to use this camera for video production and this would of been my favorite camera for the price if it wasn't for this one stupid flaw that Panasonic could easily fix but refuse too. If you wanted to use this camera for video you can and it does a great job and the focus peaking helps but when you want to move up and get an external monitor for your rig, prepare for the disappointment because as soon as you hit record the camera cuts feed to the monitor, in 4K and 1080p modes. Panasonic forces you to use their terrible app that disconnects a lot. The only way to use an external monitor is if you purchase one that also records externally. A monitor like that can cost $2000. I'm not spending that kind of money on a monitor unless i had a $10,000 camera. I'm still doing research on any camera that will allow me to use a monitor with it and is a mirrorless DSLR. anything but canon."

It has been a long time since I used a camcorder, so the first time testing the 4K recording capability blew me away. Pair with a nice tripod and the phone app, and you should have a nice setup. I have not dabbled too much into video recording with this, but I am tempted to do so. I purchased more so for the photography aspect.

Smaller then my old Nikon d5100, less heavy. What a back breaker lugging around dslr+equipment can be. Thank you, micro 4/3.

For this G7, I have the 45-150mm and 25mm lenses, and that gives me a good range for most of my everyday shoots. Portraits, some landscape, nature, ect."

I really was interested in the Nikon D5500 but in the end I decided to go with this one because it has the view finder, rotating touch screen, and 4k. Also the season screen shows you the adjustments made and if it is over exposed / too light you can change it which I think with some Nikons you are not able to. Since I'm only just a beginner this was very very useful.

I had used a Samsung F90 for years and liked it a lot but wanted a better image quality which this provided. The on board mic is fantastic and you have the option to add an external one. I recommend ordering an extra battery so you can always have one charged in case you need to swap mid project as video will drain it faster than photos. I get a couple of hours on a video charge.

It's definitely worth the price. However it's probably on sale at the time that you are reading these comments. Don't let the sales price fool you. This camera takes gorgeous pictures for beginner photographers and anyone who doesn't yet have the money to spend thousands of dollars on a professional camera. The Mirrorless touchscreen allows you to take selfies and blog-like videos. However, I would consider buying an additional lense with these. The lense that it comes with doesn't go very far at all. If you really like photographing and want to take clear, beautiful shots without being limited to 45mm, buy lense with them."

The only thing that I wasn't very happy about was that the lens (I don't know any proper camera jargon) cannot focus on things that are too close (ants, crumbs, miniature objects) or things that are to far away (birds on a tree from the house across) thus if you are either going to film very tiny objects like toys or miniature things or want to zoom in into the head of a bird from your window to a tree across the street, this is the right camera but not the right camera lense, Thus, I suggest choosing the other options with the different types of camera lenses depending on what you are going to film but the quality is amazing!"

The features packed in this little beast are perfect and intuitive for video and photo folks. I made the purchase for video only and am in no way shape or form disappointed. Seriously, Panasonic, why did I not find you earlier in life?

Now, word of warning: 4K is fun and luscios but even my reasonably fast PC can't really efficiently handle editing 4K. My advice is, if you're planning on editing, to have a workflow sorted out before you jump in.

I will be buying the GH4 very, very soon and selling my Canon gear even sooner."

Pros - light weight, after studying it for a while pretty easy to use, good battery life for how I have used it, great pictures and video. Great price for a 4k camera.

Cons - Video Image Stability not the greatest and kit lines feels cheap but both not a deal breaker."

Only downside is no headphone jack, but I record audio externally anyways so this doesn't affect me. Also make sure you get a fast SD card, as slower ones will not work with the camera if you're trying to record 4K.

It also came with a microphone plug in & you can take the screen out so that you can see yourself while recording. I also reccomend it beacuse it can shoot 4k video.

The size is rather compact, the controls are great, and the clean-hdmi output makes live streaming very easy.

Pros:
-Excellent colors
-4k for cheap
-Compact
-Good remote control app for android

Cons:
-Controls for playback aren't obvious
-Can't have live-hdmi output when recording (it must be in standby) so you get one or the other"

In auto-focus, the focus will wander during the recording and in manual focus, you have to get creative to find ways to focus on yourself if you are doing solo recordings. After a couple of botched shoots, I sent it back and went with the Sony A6600. You can find less expensive options but I found the Sony to be incredibly easy to set up and use for video.

I’m not a video blogger so I can’t speak to that aspect, specifically. But, there is very little this camera does that is not done better by other, similarly priced digital mirrorless cameras! Sure, it can zoom, but the pixels are so low that the quality will never be very good. Yes, it’s lightweight, but so are other Panasonic LUMIX cameras that are better. I just did not experience the “wow factor” I’ve experienced with other cameras, right off. I sent this one back and got, instead, the Sony a6000 mirrorless, which has phenomenal video, higher pixels, great sound quality and is lightweight and easy to use."

Camera is worth half of what I paid.,2019-10-14,I should have spent an additional $100 and got a gh4. This camera is not worth the money. Auto focus is terrible. Camera is missing accessories. Lense that was included is bad. This camera is worth about $200.

I own many that work fine. Beware Panasonic customer service has gone as low as it can. They are no help at all. Phone support takes longer than most phone batteries will last. Last call 45 min on hold no help. Chat line sends back canned responses or will have an email message later. That is always please visit us at and start all over again. So hardware is great but if you need help registering or getting to the 3 year warranty page forget it.

first off it feels like a brick of cheap plastic, not DSLR plastic but kids toy plastic
and the AFF in video mode is pathetic, I held the camera still on a bright orange then red flower it took 12 seconds
to focus, 12 seconds, and don't get me started on the rolling shutter and focus while moving!
my GX7 has far faster AFF focus and feels like an adult toy / the wrong direction Panasonic
just because of in camera 4k doesn't mean you skimp on quality..."

The camera is smaller and lighter than traditional DSLRs. It's incredibly comfortable to hold and operate--even with one hand. The auto focus is spot on, and the camera legitimately tracks moving objects quickly and precisely while still remaining focused. (It's a thing to behold.)

The EVF articulates smoothly, and the touchscreen is accurately responsive. I also appreciate that the image that shows up on the EVF is the image that is truly captured.

The camera has built-in WiFi connectivity, so you can send images to your phone. You can also control the camera with the Panasonic Image App on your phone, though I have not yet tested that capability.

The star of the show with this camera, though, is the 4K/UHD video capabilities. As the manual says, there are ""three ways to get the perfect shot"": 4K Burst (continually captures 8mp photos when shutter button remains pressed), 4K Burst Start/Stop (record a video, then play, pause, and extract any frame as an 8mp photo), and 4K Pre-Burst (initiates a 4K video sequence one second before and after the shutter button is pressed). Full HD 1080p recording is supported, but only at a lower bit rate (unless you use mp4, but then videos need to be shorter). It is simple to extract shots from the 4K stream. (FYI, since you're recording high quality HD video, you're going to need a UHS speed class 3 SD card. I used the "

Hayes,"Excellent Camera For Any Family Or Amateur Photographer, Perfect For Beginners, Feature Rich",2015-09-07,"The Panasonia Lumix 4K Mirrorless camera is an great camera to use for any amateur or family photographer to use to capture those special moments. In my test of the device I carried it around on a family trip to DC and a few other places. For many landmarks I found it to be a great device to capture photos at or even better quality than the ones one could search online for. I love this camera and found it better than those sub $250 ones. There was for example no blurriness when zooming into the maximum to capture the text on say the Lincoln Memorial with the states names on top, or capturing moving leaves of weeping willows lining a manmade pond with birds in it. I love how simple and easy the cameras intelligent auto features are for capture good photos.

Accept no substitutions and dont be one of those people with a cellphone camera and a selfie stick to capture photos, as in my experience nothing ever beats having a dedicated camera offering great zooming capabilities, limited to no blurring of important things (for example this camera works well in capturing even close up shots of peoples faces in low and limited light settings, whereas a high end phone that many people have makes peoples faces blurry or just too dark without extensive post photo modifications). This camera you dont really need many post modifications at all.

If I did have one suggestion it would be on camera sepia mode being offered and probably that they shouldnt have required that people need to have say one of the higher end memory cards for being able to save and have 4K photo capabilities. Additionally the touch screen is great but for looking at photos one just took it is quite small and unable to show you the high visual fidelity of the photo one just took. Oh well, otherwise the touch screen is great and one of my favorite features. I love being able to pick the area of focus on the camera screen."

I normally rely on a point and shoot Nikon CoolPix but I have been dying to get into more detailed photogtraphy for a long time to take pictures of my dog for her facebook page. Don't laugh, she has almost a thousand followers! My oldest brother (Canon) has been a hobby photographer for decades and my other brother (Nikon) was a professional photographer for bands back in the 70's, so I have lots of resources to help me out with this. The Canon brother was really impressed with this camera. He does only take landscapes, so he helped me out with taking stills. Once he explained the different settings to me, I had no problem keeping up with a group of photographers.

It was easy to set up, almost just like a point and shoot but has way more range in getting that special shot. I really wanted to get some action shots of my dog and this was exactly the camera for that! I can now just take video and get the shot directly from the video. You can also adjust the light for exposure and get different looks for each with out using a filter. I would recommend buying additional storage since the higher the setting the more space it uses. Since the new SD cards are always on sale someplace, it is easy to get high quality for not a lot."
