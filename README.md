# Web_Scraping_Selenium_and_Data_Preprocessing
 web scraping and data preprocessing project focused on Camera products listed on Amazon!üì∏üåê
 In this endeavor, I utilized my skills in web scraping to collect valuable data and performed various data preprocessing steps to enhance its quality and usefulness. 
 üí° Here's a summary of the key steps involved in the project:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Web Scraping:
Using advanced web scraping techniques, I collected a comprehensive dataset comprising information about Camera products available on Amazon. By leveraging Python libraries like Selenium, and pandas, I extracted vital product details such as names, prices, ratings, descriptions, and more directly from Amazon's website.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Info on Data:
Once the data was scraped, I conducted an initial analysis to data understand its structure and content. This step involved gaining insights into the dataset's size, number of records, and key variables, providing a foundation for subsequent data preprocessing steps.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning:
I employed advanced data-cleaning techniques to ensure the integrity and reliability of the collected data. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicate entries, and addressing any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the dataset obtained from the web scraping process.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Reduction:
To simplify the dataset and focus on the most relevant information, I performed data reduction techniques. This involved filtering out unnecessary variables or columns that didn't contribute significantly to the analysis, and streamlining the dataset for further processing and analysis.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation:
To facilitate further analysis and exploration, I transformed the data into a suitable format. This step involved converting data types, and normalizing values.
